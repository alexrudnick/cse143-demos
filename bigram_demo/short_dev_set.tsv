steadily pursued in all slave who have appealed to the protection of the courts having their cases upon on the most liberal terms consistent with justice to the and a considerable number have availed themselves of the presented to them and bought up the claims upon further and more intimate knowledge of the people has confirmed the impression that whatever may have been the case in former times cruelty to slaves or slave has been very rare since the of settled government and in every instance in which such has come to mj knowledge or to that of the british officers compensation was carried out three such cases have occurred in the families of two very high officers of state and these with one other case are all the instances of cruelty which have been reported to me an attempt was made in to procure a of the population through the chiefs of the village each of these chiefs recorded the name of every in his district with the number of persons their sex and condition a total of is thus arrived at for the free native population of these were above and below years of age the females numbered and the number of slaves was returned as of whom were and females the slave were and giving a total of the two classes of both sexes i fear however that these numbers do not include all the bond population as his the and one or two others with extensive claims did not give in returns i regret to state that the attempt which as reported in my letter of the th december was liberally made by the chief wife of the ex of p to the of her slaves and by working off the just claims against them on fair terms was successful only to a very extent the of are as a rule so adverse to and so to steady labour and can so easily provide for their wants that they altogether decline except for short periods to perform services of any nature even for high wages the opinion of those having claims upon the classes is now pretty general in favour of upon terms and although a few old in such districts as would prefer to to the former state of things i have considered that the time has arrived when a general measure having this end in view may be taken into consideration in the hope of carrying it out completely in the year his the governor may have observed in tbe minutes of the march of the council of state that the subject of of slaves and was brought to the notice of his the by the resident and that a meeting of the council was appointed for the th may for the purpose of considering the terms on which such a measure should be based and the manner in which it should be carried out my own idea is that a commission consisting of one or two native and the principal european officer of each district should be appointed to inquire under written instructions into the circumstances of each case and subject to the approval of the government such compensation as may seem fair to both parties that the money necessary to pay the shall be advanced by the government that the sum to be paid for shall remain in whole or in part as may be determined in council a debt from the to the state which he shall be bound to repay by a of a portion of his wages for labour on the public works of the country which he must continue until his debt is cleared off should he be or unwilling to raise the money by other means that male relatives shall take upon them the obligations incurred for the freedom of female relations who may themselves be unable to pay and that from the date of the completion of the measure every person in the state shall be absolutely free and slavery and bond declared to be institutions and for ever i have formerly stated it sa the opinion of the best informed natives that a sum varying from to would be sufficient to meet the necessary expenditure

his mind by god if she were but english she were not in this place another half a second it was the soldier in him to the soldier in her but what a rebuke it was what an of french character and french

crime of  singular logic she answered simply i am not by this it i could escape i would not reproach myself for i have given no promise and i shall not then she complained of the burden of her chains and asked that they might be removed for she was strongly guarded in that and there was no need of them but the bishop refused and reminded her that she had broken out of prison twice before of arc was too proud to insist she only said as she rose to go with the guard it is true i have wanted to escape and i do want to escape then she added in a way that would touch the pity of anybody i think it is the right of every prisoner and so she went from the place in the midst of an impressive which made the and more to me the of those pathetic chains what presence of mind she had i one could never surprise her out of it she saw and me there when she first took her seat on her bench and we flushed to the forehead with excitement and emotion but her face showed nothing betrayed nothing her

which was his favorite and most frequent menace the matter had gotten abroad and was making great and unpleasant talk and would not try to repeat this shabby game right away it comforted me to hear

know that she cared for him he wondered if she would take it much to heart when he had to tell her that the separation was inevitable she did not seem as if she would cry herself into a consumption she would understand his position and not blame him for what he could not help it would be as hard for him as for her too and she ought to feel that when should he tell her not yet at least not before came home he pictured to himself a week without either of them and it looked like a very dismal prospect saw that he had become thoughtful and she tried to rally him with only partial success if any one should try to separate us he said as they were standing at the door what would you do keep my word was her calm answer supposing your parents objected supposing they said to you that they would never consent knowing that her father and mother fully approved of her choice this did not give the girl any uneasiness and her reply was prompt i should feel that the matter was one the only one perhaps in the world in which i was justified in their wishes but he persisted if they told you that such a marriage would forever cut you off from them that the they would never afterward recognize you as their child she put her round arms about his neck in all her innocent truth and love i should take you against them all for i should feel that they were the claim of relationship when they tried to make my life unhappy he stooped and kissed her wondering what there was in him to make so beautiful a being show this devotion then he went to his home with his problem farther than ever from

his wife he still liked her a great deal but the parental direction to take her from that fondness which formerly made it impossible to tell any difference between her and there was a difference now and it was all in f of the creature who held his senses in whenever he was in her presence whose face and cutting the mill bank voice and the touch of whose hand followed him even to his dreams but he wrote to such letters as he used to write when he first went to school joined to a few more tender things which he thought the coming conditions her letters to him were sweet and tender without

for the restoration of the was a woman of masculine understanding young and beautiful she possessed everything save a heart and she used all the charms of which she was mistress  and they were many  to gain her ambition queen elizabeth without the of that great sovereign of russia with no mary of scotland of a midnight meeting tendencies  this woman of twenty five years of age deemed that there was one destiny in the world for her to be a queen and reign as a queen never the slave of her passions always and alert gifted with foresight and tact she was a woman to be admired  and dreaded paradise who knew her better than any one else said that she would sacrifice au to her ambition and he was right in this reading of her character she was bom to reign and the weaknesses of her sex were not for her physically she was a woman in all else a man such a woman it can be easily seen what an f e was laying up for himself gallant and ardent he believed that he could awaken in this warmth to his passion but he was mad to dream of such a thing she saw in him a useful tool and bound him to her interests by letting him think that she was not deaf to his sighing when all the time her head governed her heart and she would have killed him with pleasure had the condition of his death gained her the throne of paradise saw how mistaken was the young man and despite his devotion to the princess could not help to that he was making a mistake in thus hoping for the impossible the duke never him he thought de the most perfect of her sex and hoped when he gave her a throne she would reward him with a heart he did not know the woman with whom he had to deal in london blinded by passion those who loved madame de for her beautiful face did not estimate her character truly but her political both knew and dreaded it it will be a bad time for peace when de gets her throne again said a to for she is too ambitious to rest content with and will never be satisfied till she has the empire and seated herself on the throne of the eastern laughed at this but did not deny the truth of the remark knowing in his own heart how true it was he was devoted to the he admired his mistress for her brilliant qualities but he also knew that she was a pitiless woman who would spare neither friend nor foe so that she could gain her ends love  the very idea was ridiculous she would marry for political purposes for the sake of the but not for love and therefore was sorry for to whom he had taken a great fancy needless to say princess was delighted at the chance of securing a wealthy like hitherto a want of money had been the great stumbling block in all her schemes but now that she had a chance of obtaining a million sterling she deemed  and justly  that the worst part of her troubles were over force could doubtless do a good deal in the way of her throne but cunning could do more and she quite agreed a midnight meeting of regarding the power of gold that handful of which now governed were by no means and a little judicious would go a long way towards turning them from into once this was achieved she would be proclaimed queen then  well those who knew the merciless nature of princess could guess that she would bitterly revenge herself on the who sold their services for money such then was the woman who presided over the meeting at the house in square she sat m the drawing room surrounded by her friends and listened to the various opinions expressed regarding the projected attempt even in exile she kept up her state and not until she gave the signal did those around venture to seat themselves in her presence the only woman present she bore herself with dignity and looked as though she were over a council of states of being a sovereign discussing desperate schemes with a dozen or so political for the most part she kept silent but every now and then she threw in a word which showed that she fully understood the various views put forward by her devoted de had not more than de each person as he wished to address the assemblage arose to his feet and just now the was standing by the chair of his mistress informing his of the offer made by neither that gentleman nor major in london and madame murmured in a low tone bending towards her de darted a meaning glance at the young man which hinted that his reward would be the highest of all she well knew that the only way to keep the duke true to her cause was to encourage his romantic passion and therefore affected an interest in him which she did not feel any woman would have been touched by s devotion but this princess had a heart of flint she was a queen not a woman and both somewhat agitated were duly introduced to madame de who graciously permitted them to kiss her hand this ceremony

of about thirty years of age put a few questions to  who was quiet and of her words  and then returned to her own affairs spent much of her time in prayer and filled up the rest of it in spinning for her hostess on the following day she was preparing to repeat her visit to sir robert de when standing at her door exclaimed  maiden here comes our nobly won in his stole and with him the governor and sundry other persons and they are making straight for this house if the governor comes to me it will save my going to him said as she spoke de entered accompanied by the de and de while a little knot of curious remained outside looked somewhat alarmed but displayed simple surprise that is the girl said sir robert abruptly to the without addressing a word to either of the women and scarcely looking at them  her at once and let us see what comes of it the who was rather young and looking proceeded to any evil spirit that might be in her to come out of her m a noble purpose and any good spirit that might be in her to remain where he was all this submitted to very calmly after which she told the governor she hoped he had satisfied himself that she was not in league with the powers of darkness all the better for you if you are not replied he take heed to give no colour to such a supposition by your future conduct saying which he turned on his heel and was followed by all but the de what did it all mean said looking bewildered oh said smiling do you not know there is an old prophecy that a maid between and shall save france i am that maid et earn si ab et si  ii nobly won looked for she had heard the prophecy formerly but had not connected it with de now broke silence maiden said he you have well borne the test do not fear the of the governor it is his duty to be wary and send the no however i think you will win to him yet and as the dangers by the road will be great i offer myself to you in all true as your champion to see you safe to the saying which he kissed the of his sword u do you accept me t most certainly i do said colouring with pleasure and i thank heaven for having given me so honourable a conductor ah surely all must go well since assistance is thus vouchsafed me de addressed a few more words to her but finding her shy and tongue tied a noble purpose courteously bent his head and relieved her of his presence thinking her the simplest in the world and smiling to see how little she troubled herself as to who was to bear the expenses of travelling or feared to trust herself with one of whom she absolutely knew nothing meanwhile the who had lately her saw her quietly come into church with her hostess and perform her with the utmost appearance of seriousness and piety j and was thereby impressed in her favour on returning to her lodging met the de who had not yet spoken to her but who did so now as if they were on the best of terms he had been with de about her and was curious to hear what she had to say for herself ma said he cheerfully what is this you are doing here must we not submit to nobly won see the king from his kingdom and ourselves becoming english sir said she very seriously i am come to ask the de to send me to the he has no care for me nor for any words of mine but yet it is needful that before mid lent i should stand in the s presence even should i in reaching him wear through my feet and have to crawl upon my knees for no one upon this earth neither king nor duke nor of the king of no one but myself is appointed to recover this realm of france yet i would willingly remain to spin by my poor mother for war seems no work for me but go i must because my master wills it whom call you your master then said de there was talk at this time of the infant son of charles vii to the daughter of the king of a noble purpose  the king of heaven replied she reverently he it is who has sent me well said de holding out his hand to her i believe you say true and i promise you on the faith of a gentleman and in the hearing of god that i will lead you myself before the king when do you wish to begin your journey sooner now than to morrow and sooner to morrow than later replied she there are things to be thought of first rejoined de do you mean to go in the clothes you have on you must ride a horse for about four hundred miles and those short red of yours are scarcely suitable the voices replied she have told me to wear the garb of a man et post  of de nobly won oh indeed said de with a sudden movement of his eyebrows for this was his first introduction to the voices and he did not precisely know what to think of them and have you any clothes of that sort to wear no said faltering for she could not think of any one but her uncle likely to lend them her and a sudden quick blush as bright as it was unexpected arose in her face as it occurred to her how she would look in a suit of s never mind said	charles-darwin
mistaken but for anybody who tells so many things she is seldom entirely wrong besides i half think that in a village like ours thoughts escape and themselves i am sometimes almost afraid as i write things down in this of mine lest they shall somehow get from the page into the air and aunt will know them the next time she appears this is to me the worst thing about living in a small place it is impossible not to have the feeling of being under a sort of foolish slavery to public opinion a regard to feelings we neither share nor respect and greater still is danger of coming to be interested in trifles of growing to be just as we are simply from living where it is so difficult not to know all about our neighbors speculation was the word which to day aunt rolled as a sweet morsel under her tongue any sort of financial dealing is so strangely far away from our ordinary village ways that any sort of dealing in stocks would i suppose be regarded as rash if not altogether but i do hope that there is nothing in george s business which will lead him into trouble i know that i am about something which is none of my affair and which is probably all right if it has any existence i don t know much about speculation myself the of a saint aunt observed and i doubt if george does he s got a wife who seems bound to spend every cent she can get hold of and it looks as if he found he d got to take extra pains to get it but how should anybody anything about his affairs i asked in perplexed vexation she regarded me everybody knows everything in a place like this she responded i m sure i don t see how everything gets to be known but it does you can t deny that i told her that i was afraid we were dreadfully given to about our neighbors and to talking about things which really did n t concern us some do i suppose she answered coolly but with a twinkle from behind the green veil which is always across her face it s a pity of course but you would n t have us so little interested in each other as not to notice the things we hear would you i laughed of course but did not give up my point entirely but so much that is said is nonsense i persisted here mrs has been in for four or five months and she is already with running into extravagance and bringing her husband into all sorts of things we might at least give her time to get settled before we talk about her so much she had n t been here four or five weeks before she made it plain enough what she is was the promising retort she set out to astonish us as soon as she came that s her western spirit i suppose i did not go on with the talk but secretly the thing august troubles me speculation is a large word and it is nonsense to suppose george to be in any way could come to much or that aunt would know it if he were i do wish people would either stop talking about george or talk to somebody besides me august mrs came in to call to day she makes a round of calls about once in two years and i have not seen her for a long time she had her usual string of questions and asked about me and baby and tom and the girls and the summer preserving until i felt as if i had been through the longest kind of a cross examination just before she left she inquired if mrs had told me that her husband was going to make a lot of money in stocks i said at once that i seldom saw mrs and that i knew nothing about her husband s business affairs but this shows where aunt got her information mrs must have been talking i wonder  but it seems to me i am always wondering august has not been near me since she left the house the other evening it seemed better to let her work out things in her own way than to go after her i hoped that if i took no notice she might forget her foolishness and behave in a more natural way i met her in the street this afternoon and stopped to speak with her i said nothing of her having run away but talked as usual at last i asked her if she would not come home with me and she turned and came to the gate then i asked her to come in but she stopped short is the baby gone she demanded the of a saint no i answered you know i shall never come into your house again while that baby is there she declared in an odd quiet sort of way i hate that baby and he that hates is just like a murderer she said it with a certain relish as if she were proud of it i begin to suspect that there may be a good deal of the theatrical mixed with her feeling i said you may be as silly as you like but you can t make me believe anything so absurd as that you hate as for being a murderer in your heart you would n t hurt a fly she looked at me i half thought there was a little disappointment in her first glance then a strange expression as if she unconsciously took herself for audience since i would not serve and went on with her play of wickedness you don t know how wicked i am she responded i am a murderer in my	charles-dickens
