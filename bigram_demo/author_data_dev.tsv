steadily pursued in all slave who have appealed to the protection of the courts having their cases upon on the most liberal terms consistent with justice to the and a considerable number have availed themselves of the presented to them and bought up the claims upon further and more intimate knowledge of the people has confirmed the impression that whatever may have been the case in former times cruelty to slaves or slave has been very rare since the of settled government and in every instance in which such has come to mj knowledge or to that of the british officers compensation was carried out three such cases have occurred in the families of two very high officers of state and these with one other case are all the instances of cruelty which have been reported to me an attempt was made in to procure a of the population through the chiefs of the village each of these chiefs recorded the name of every in his district with the number of persons their sex and condition a total of is thus arrived at for the free native population of these were above and below years of age the females numbered and the number of slaves was returned as of whom were and females the slave were and giving a total of the two classes of both sexes i fear however that these numbers do not include all the bond population as his the and one or two others with extensive claims did not give in returns i regret to state that the attempt which as reported in my letter of the th december was liberally made by the chief wife of the ex of p to the of her slaves and by working off the just claims against them on fair terms was successful only to a very extent the of are as a rule so adverse to and so to steady labour and can so easily provide for their wants that they altogether decline except for short periods to perform services of any nature even for high wages the opinion of those having claims upon the classes is now pretty general in favour of upon terms and although a few old in such districts as would prefer to to the former state of things i have considered that the time has arrived when a general measure having this end in view may be taken into consideration in the hope of carrying it out completely in the year his the governor may have observed in tbe minutes of the march of the council of state that the subject of of slaves and was brought to the notice of his the by the resident and that a meeting of the council was appointed for the th may for the purpose of considering the terms on which such a measure should be based and the manner in which it should be carried out my own idea is that a commission consisting of one or two native and the principal european officer of each district should be appointed to inquire under written instructions into the circumstances of each case and subject to the approval of the government such compensation as may seem fair to both parties that the money necessary to pay the shall be advanced by the government that the sum to be paid for shall remain in whole or in part as may be determined in council a debt from the to the state which he shall be bound to repay by a of a portion of his wages for labour on the public works of the country which he must continue until his debt is cleared off should he be or unwilling to raise the money by other means that male relatives shall take upon them the obligations incurred for the freedom of female relations who may themselves be unable to pay and that from the date of the completion of the measure every person in the state shall be absolutely free and slavery and bond declared to be institutions and for ever i have formerly stated it sa the opinion of the best informed natives that a sum varying from to would be sufficient to meet the necessary expenditure

his mind by god if she were but english she were not in this place another half a second it was the soldier in him to the soldier in her but what a rebuke it was what an of french character and french

crime of  singular logic she answered simply i am not by this it i could escape i would not reproach myself for i have given no promise and i shall not then she complained of the burden of her chains and asked that they might be removed for she was strongly guarded in that and there was no need of them but the bishop refused and reminded her that she had broken out of prison twice before of arc was too proud to insist she only said as she rose to go with the guard it is true i have wanted to escape and i do want to escape then she added in a way that would touch the pity of anybody i think it is the right of every prisoner and so she went from the place in the midst of an impressive which made the and more to me the of those pathetic chains what presence of mind she had i one could never surprise her out of it she saw and me there when she first took her seat on her bench and we flushed to the forehead with excitement and emotion but her face showed nothing betrayed nothing her

which was his favorite and most frequent menace the matter had gotten abroad and was making great and unpleasant talk and would not try to repeat this shabby game right away it comforted me to hear

know that she cared for him he wondered if she would take it much to heart when he had to tell her that the separation was inevitable she did not seem as if she would cry herself into a consumption she would understand his position and not blame him for what he could not help it would be as hard for him as for her too and she ought to feel that when should he tell her not yet at least not before came home he pictured to himself a week without either of them and it looked like a very dismal prospect saw that he had become thoughtful and she tried to rally him with only partial success if any one should try to separate us he said as they were standing at the door what would you do keep my word was her calm answer supposing your parents objected supposing they said to you that they would never consent knowing that her father and mother fully approved of her choice this did not give the girl any uneasiness and her reply was prompt i should feel that the matter was one the only one perhaps in the world in which i was justified in their wishes but he persisted if they told you that such a marriage would forever cut you off from them that the they would never afterward recognize you as their child she put her round arms about his neck in all her innocent truth and love i should take you against them all for i should feel that they were the claim of relationship when they tried to make my life unhappy he stooped and kissed her wondering what there was in him to make so beautiful a being show this devotion then he went to his home with his problem farther than ever from

his wife he still liked her a great deal but the parental direction to take her from that fondness which formerly made it impossible to tell any difference between her and there was a difference now and it was all in f of the creature who held his senses in whenever he was in her presence whose face and cutting the mill bank voice and the touch of whose hand followed him even to his dreams but he wrote to such letters as he used to write when he first went to school joined to a few more tender things which he thought the coming conditions her letters to him were sweet and tender without

for the restoration of the was a woman of masculine understanding young and beautiful she possessed everything save a heart and she used all the charms of which she was mistress  and they were many  to gain her ambition queen elizabeth without the of that great sovereign of russia with no mary of scotland of a midnight meeting tendencies  this woman of twenty five years of age deemed that there was one destiny in the world for her to be a queen and reign as a queen never the slave of her passions always and alert gifted with foresight and tact she was a woman to be admired  and dreaded paradise who knew her better than any one else said that she would sacrifice au to her ambition and he was right in this reading of her character she was bom to reign and the weaknesses of her sex were not for her physically she was a woman in all else a man such a woman it can be easily seen what an f e was laying up for himself gallant and ardent he believed that he could awaken in this warmth to his passion but he was mad to dream of such a thing she saw in him a useful tool and bound him to her interests by letting him think that she was not deaf to his sighing when all the time her head governed her heart and she would have killed him with pleasure had the condition of his death gained her the throne of paradise saw how mistaken was the young man and despite his devotion to the princess could not help to that he was making a mistake in thus hoping for the impossible the duke never him he thought de the most perfect of her sex and hoped when he gave her a throne she would reward him with a heart he did not know the woman with whom he had to deal in london blinded by passion those who loved madame de for her beautiful face did not estimate her character truly but her political both knew and dreaded it it will be a bad time for peace when de gets her throne again said a to for she is too ambitious to rest content with and will never be satisfied till she has the empire and seated herself on the throne of the eastern laughed at this but did not deny the truth of the remark knowing in his own heart how true it was he was devoted to the he admired his mistress for her brilliant qualities but he also knew that she was a pitiless woman who would spare neither friend nor foe so that she could gain her ends love  the very idea was ridiculous she would marry for political purposes for the sake of the but not for love and therefore was sorry for to whom he had taken a great fancy needless to say princess was delighted at the chance of securing a wealthy like hitherto a want of money had been the great stumbling block in all her schemes but now that she had a chance of obtaining a million sterling she deemed  and justly  that the worst part of her troubles were over force could doubtless do a good deal in the way of her throne but cunning could do more and she quite agreed a midnight meeting of regarding the power of gold that handful of which now governed were by no means and a little judicious would go a long way towards turning them from into once this was achieved she would be proclaimed queen then  well those who knew the merciless nature of princess could guess that she would bitterly revenge herself on the who sold their services for money such then was the woman who presided over the meeting at the house in square she sat m the drawing room surrounded by her friends and listened to the various opinions expressed regarding the projected attempt even in exile she kept up her state and not until she gave the signal did those around venture to seat themselves in her presence the only woman present she bore herself with dignity and looked as though she were over a council of states of being a sovereign discussing desperate schemes with a dozen or so political for the most part she kept silent but every now and then she threw in a word which showed that she fully understood the various views put forward by her devoted de had not more than de each person as he wished to address the assemblage arose to his feet and just now the was standing by the chair of his mistress informing his of the offer made by neither that gentleman nor major in london and madame murmured in a low tone bending towards her de darted a meaning glance at the young man which hinted that his reward would be the highest of all she well knew that the only way to keep the duke true to her cause was to encourage his romantic passion and therefore affected an interest in him which she did not feel any woman would have been touched by s devotion but this princess had a heart of flint she was a queen not a woman and both somewhat agitated were duly introduced to madame de who graciously permitted them to kiss her hand this ceremony

of about thirty years of age put a few questions to  who was quiet and of her words  and then returned to her own affairs spent much of her time in prayer and filled up the rest of it in spinning for her hostess on the following day she was preparing to repeat her visit to sir robert de when standing at her door exclaimed  maiden here comes our nobly won in his stole and with him the governor and sundry other persons and they are making straight for this house if the governor comes to me it will save my going to him said as she spoke de entered accompanied by the de and de while a little knot of curious remained outside looked somewhat alarmed but displayed simple surprise that is the girl said sir robert abruptly to the without addressing a word to either of the women and scarcely looking at them  her at once and let us see what comes of it the who was rather young and looking proceeded to any evil spirit that might be in her to come out of her m a noble purpose and any good spirit that might be in her to remain where he was all this submitted to very calmly after which she told the governor she hoped he had satisfied himself that she was not in league with the powers of darkness all the better for you if you are not replied he take heed to give no colour to such a supposition by your future conduct saying which he turned on his heel and was followed by all but the de what did it all mean said looking bewildered oh said smiling do you not know there is an old prophecy that a maid between and shall save france i am that maid et earn si ab et si  ii nobly won looked for she had heard the prophecy formerly but had not connected it with de now broke silence maiden said he you have well borne the test do not fear the of the governor it is his duty to be wary and send the no however i think you will win to him yet and as the dangers by the road will be great i offer myself to you in all true as your champion to see you safe to the saying which he kissed the of his sword u do you accept me t most certainly i do said colouring with pleasure and i thank heaven for having given me so honourable a conductor ah surely all must go well since assistance is thus vouchsafed me de addressed a few more words to her but finding her shy and tongue tied a noble purpose courteously bent his head and relieved her of his presence thinking her the simplest in the world and smiling to see how little she troubled herself as to who was to bear the expenses of travelling or feared to trust herself with one of whom she absolutely knew nothing meanwhile the who had lately her saw her quietly come into church with her hostess and perform her with the utmost appearance of seriousness and piety j and was thereby impressed in her favour on returning to her lodging met the de who had not yet spoken to her but who did so now as if they were on the best of terms he had been with de about her and was curious to hear what she had to say for herself ma said he cheerfully what is this you are doing here must we not submit to nobly won see the king from his kingdom and ourselves becoming english sir said she very seriously i am come to ask the de to send me to the he has no care for me nor for any words of mine but yet it is needful that before mid lent i should stand in the s presence even should i in reaching him wear through my feet and have to crawl upon my knees for no one upon this earth neither king nor duke nor of the king of no one but myself is appointed to recover this realm of france yet i would willingly remain to spin by my poor mother for war seems no work for me but go i must because my master wills it whom call you your master then said de there was talk at this time of the infant son of charles vii to the daughter of the king of a noble purpose  the king of heaven replied she reverently he it is who has sent me well said de holding out his hand to her i believe you say true and i promise you on the faith of a gentleman and in the hearing of god that i will lead you myself before the king when do you wish to begin your journey sooner now than to morrow and sooner to morrow than later replied she there are things to be thought of first rejoined de do you mean to go in the clothes you have on you must ride a horse for about four hundred miles and those short red of yours are scarcely suitable the voices replied she have told me to wear the garb of a man et post  of de nobly won oh indeed said de with a sudden movement of his eyebrows for this was his first introduction to the voices and he did not precisely know what to think of them and have you any clothes of that sort to wear no said faltering for she could not think of any one but her uncle likely to lend them her and a sudden quick blush as bright as it was unexpected arose in her face as it occurred to her how she would look in a suit of s never mind said	charles-darwin
mistaken but for anybody who tells so many things she is seldom entirely wrong besides i half think that in a village like ours thoughts escape and themselves i am sometimes almost afraid as i write things down in this of mine lest they shall somehow get from the page into the air and aunt will know them the next time she appears this is to me the worst thing about living in a small place it is impossible not to have the feeling of being under a sort of foolish slavery to public opinion a regard to feelings we neither share nor respect and greater still is danger of coming to be interested in trifles of growing to be just as we are simply from living where it is so difficult not to know all about our neighbors speculation was the word which to day aunt rolled as a sweet morsel under her tongue any sort of financial dealing is so strangely far away from our ordinary village ways that any sort of dealing in stocks would i suppose be regarded as rash if not altogether but i do hope that there is nothing in george s business which will lead him into trouble i know that i am about something which is none of my affair and which is probably all right if it has any existence i don t know much about speculation myself the of a saint aunt observed and i doubt if george does he s got a wife who seems bound to spend every cent she can get hold of and it looks as if he found he d got to take extra pains to get it but how should anybody anything about his affairs i asked in perplexed vexation she regarded me everybody knows everything in a place like this she responded i m sure i don t see how everything gets to be known but it does you can t deny that i told her that i was afraid we were dreadfully given to about our neighbors and to talking about things which really did n t concern us some do i suppose she answered coolly but with a twinkle from behind the green veil which is always across her face it s a pity of course but you would n t have us so little interested in each other as not to notice the things we hear would you i laughed of course but did not give up my point entirely but so much that is said is nonsense i persisted here mrs has been in for four or five months and she is already with running into extravagance and bringing her husband into all sorts of things we might at least give her time to get settled before we talk about her so much she had n t been here four or five weeks before she made it plain enough what she is was the promising retort she set out to astonish us as soon as she came that s her western spirit i suppose i did not go on with the talk but secretly the thing august troubles me speculation is a large word and it is nonsense to suppose george to be in any way could come to much or that aunt would know it if he were i do wish people would either stop talking about george or talk to somebody besides me august mrs came in to call to day she makes a round of calls about once in two years and i have not seen her for a long time she had her usual string of questions and asked about me and baby and tom and the girls and the summer preserving until i felt as if i had been through the longest kind of a cross examination just before she left she inquired if mrs had told me that her husband was going to make a lot of money in stocks i said at once that i seldom saw mrs and that i knew nothing about her husband s business affairs but this shows where aunt got her information mrs must have been talking i wonder  but it seems to me i am always wondering august has not been near me since she left the house the other evening it seemed better to let her work out things in her own way than to go after her i hoped that if i took no notice she might forget her foolishness and behave in a more natural way i met her in the street this afternoon and stopped to speak with her i said nothing of her having run away but talked as usual at last i asked her if she would not come home with me and she turned and came to the gate then i asked her to come in but she stopped short is the baby gone she demanded the of a saint no i answered you know i shall never come into your house again while that baby is there she declared in an odd quiet sort of way i hate that baby and he that hates is just like a murderer she said it with a certain relish as if she were proud of it i begin to suspect that there may be a good deal of the theatrical mixed with her feeling i said you may be as silly as you like but you can t make me believe anything so absurd as that you hate as for being a murderer in your heart you would n t hurt a fly she looked at me i half thought there was a little disappointment in her first glance then a strange expression as if she unconsciously took herself for audience since i would not serve and went on with her play of wickedness you don t know how wicked i am she responded i am a murderer in my	charles-dickens

situated in a dark narrow street in the city which led down to the river in former days the place might have been respectable and then the original had set lip his official tent in the neighborhood but civilization h d moved westward and street was looked on by fashionable nevertheless the firm of continued to dwell in the dingy office where their had for close on a hundred years it was quite good enough thought the present head of the firm for such well known lawyers the firm did a good old fashioned business eminently respectable and safe none of the three partners was a as asserted but as the firm had issued a judgment summons against the master of the elms he could scarcely be expected to think well of them old mr rarely came to the office preferring his country house and beds and the business was conducted by the son and the other who was a cousin both these gentlemen were over forty and in spite of a modem education were decidedly old fashioned there was a strange discovery something in the air of the street office that them into old men before their due time the three clerks who sat in the outer rooms were also elderly and the sole youthful creature about the place was the office boy a red haired who to the name of alexander his was but was not thought sufficiently dignified for use in so a place of business with some difficulty steel found this haunt of the legal muse and sent up his name to the senior partner with a request for an interview alexander whistling between his teeth led him into a apartment lined with books and tin boxes and furnished with a green covered table heaped with legal papers three chairs and a mahogany sofa of the early period mr the son might have belonged to the same epoch in spite of his age so rusty and did he look his face was clean shaven with the exception of side whiskers his hair was thin on the top and on the sides and he was dressed in a suit of solemn black with a satin tie to match in fact he was the typical lawyer of and steel was surprised to find so ancient a in these modem days but when they began to talk proved to be quite able to hold his own and was not at all in brain whatever he might be in appearance he knew not only the name of steel but all about the case and steel s connection he referred in feeling terms to s death a very charming girl mr steel said the lawyer on several occasions she has been here to draw her little income it is sad that she should have met with her death at the hands of a jealous woman at the very time she was about to enjoy a of five thousand a year a coin of edward vii you don t say so cried steel who had heard nothing of this ah mr never informed you of the fact well no he didn t but then i have not seen him for over a week i believe he is at with his wife who left this money to the late miss a relative of hers who died lately in and failing her who mr reflected i don t know that you have any right to ask that question he said after a pause pardon me replied the miss was murdered i fancied that the money might have something to do with the commission of the crime no mr steel i read the evidence given at the jealousy was the motive of the crime and miss is guilty i am somewhat of that way of thinking myself mr and on the face of it there is no other way of for the murder nevertheless it is just as well to look at the matter from all sides the crime may be connected with the question of this fortune you may as well tell me what i wish to know i ll keep my mouth closed are you going to accuse our of the crime asked i fear you will waste your time if you do since you look at the matter in this way i don t mind speaking about what after all is not your business that is as it may be returned steel passed this remark over failing miss the five

he ought to be told the state of things it was imperative that he should know about the poor girl i have never been able to be sure why he did not let his family know where he was but i fear he may have with them now he must be told oh it is such wretched business so sad and dreadful i went upstairs after thinking by the fire until it had burned to embers and indeed until the very ashes were cold i took out tom s letter and for a moment i was half sick at the thought that he had degraded himself so it seemed almost as if in holding his letter i was touching her and i would gladly have thrown it in the fire then i was ashamed to be so and so and realized how foolish i was the sealed envelope had in it a card with tom s address in new york and this note  march if you open this it must mean that you know i have nothing to say in my own that you could understand only this is true i have never really cared for any woman in the world but you you will not believe it and you will not be likely to find it very easy to forgive me for saying it now but it is true i never knew better how completely you have possession of me than i do just at this moment when know i am writing what you wiu read me no i suppose you can t really hate anybody but you must despise me and it is an insult for me to say i love you but i have loved you all my life and i cannot help it i shall go on till i die even if you do not speak to me again in my whole life do not make me come home unless i must forgive me if you can the note had neither end nor beginning i was so overcome by it all by the pity of it that i could not trust myself to think i sat down and wrote to tom just this message without salutation or signature  your father has been here to see me the girl is ill of her baby was born night before last and is alive i sent this off to day what he will do i cannot tell i cannot even be sure what he ought to do and i had no right to urge him to come or to stay away certainly for him to marry that outcast creature seems impossible but if he does not the baby must go through life with a brand of shame on her the world is so cruel to children perhaps it has to be at least father believed that the only preservation of society lay in this severity but i am a woman and i think of the children who are not to blame things are so tangled up in human relations the of a saint that one thread cannot be drawn without bringing about on other lines yet to marry this girl  oh it is not possible to think of tom s living in the same house with that dreadful creature of his having it known that he had married such a woman  it is horrible whichever way i look at it i cannot be kind in my thoughts to one of them without being cruel to the other i am so thankful that i have not to decide i know i should be too weak to be just and then i should be always unhappy at the wrong i had done now whatever i was called upon to take the responsibility of was done when i had written to tom iv april april when a new month comes in it always seems as if something should happen the divisions of time do not appeal to the feelings as simple arbitrary but as real and so the fancy demands that the old order shall end and some better new fashion begin i suppose everybody has had the vague sense of disappointment that the new month or the new year is so like the one before i used to feel this very strongly as a child though never unhappily it was a disappointment but as all times were happy times the disappointment was not bitter the thought is in my mind to night because i am troubled and because i would so gladly leave the fret and worry behind to begin afresh with the new month the thought of tom and his trouble on me so that i have been miserable all day miss has not been here this week her beloved plants need attention and she is doing mysterious things with and selecting out seeds making plans for her garden beds and working herself into a delightful fever of excitement over the coming glories of her garden it is really rather early i think but in her impatience she cannot wait her flowers are her children and all her affection for family and kin having nothing nearer to the of a saint cling to is on them it is so fortunate that she has this taste i cannot help to day feeling so old and lonely that i could almost envy her her fondness for i must cultivate a taste for something if it is only for cats i wonder how peter would like to have me set up an asylum for crippled and over and over again i have asked myself what i can do to help but i have found no answer one of the hardest things in life is to see our friends bear the consequences of their mistakes daniel is suffering for the way he brought tom up and yet he has done as well as he was able father used to say	charles-dickens
man lord richard and sion naturally weakened my instinctive opposition to these sudden schemes finally my friend begged me not to hurry back i hastened to assure him that i should make no unnecessary delay and that if i were ever fortunate enough to gain a seat in the house even that need not prevent me from making myself useful to him i could still act as secretary i said no no no  damn it no he cried and hurried out of the room i laughed at the joke but i was still by doubts how true my instinct was has yet to be shown alas i lingered at the cordiality of the amiable if member for the the stupidity of the principal the luxury of the castle in which i was a guest  all these combined to my absence from my friend slowly and happily i was winning my way into popular favor day by day in the leisurely life of that quiet spot i was my position as its future representative when on a sudden i was awakened from my by the news of the great catastrophe it was in the library of his home that i opened the paper with no and read that lord richard had been blinded by a flash of lightning i could scarcely believe my eyes such was my faith in the man s craft and power that i could scarcely imagine him the victim of an accident i found it hard to believe that anything had happened to him which was not the result of his own calculations even when i had realized the dreadful truth i had no suspicion of the extent of lord richard and i the misfortune which had befallen me indeed i saw good in the evil i saw that lord richard s blindness would make him doubly dependent on my care and help although i noted  as it is my habit to note details apparently unimportant  that when lord richard met with his terrible accident he was driving himself home from the in which my cousin tom lived i confess that i attached no importance to the fact it was not for the sake of playing with lightning that my friend had planned my absence in his native i did not waste time in idle i left that to the victim s at the castle now was the time for me to hurry to lord richard s side no one knew better than i what is expected from a friend i had studied the subject after all proper expressions of i hurried from the noble mansion where i had passed such happy hours as soon as i reached london i hurried to my friend s abode i let myself in by means of one of his latch keys which i always carried i stepped noiselessly upstairs i did not know in what condition the nerves of the poor sufferer might be at the top of the stairs i turned aside into the little back room i peeped cautiously round the heavy curtain which hung across the open doorway i feared that my sudden appearance might the invalid as i peered cautiously into the shaded study i was reassured by the sound of my friend s voice he was speaking in his usual tone with that blunt straightforward manner which i envied for lord richard and i a moment i thought that the whole story must be false i drew back my head that i might consider my position then it struck me that he might be his misfortune  pretending to be wholly blind that he might excite to the highest point the popular interest and sympathy in this i did him more than credit i waited in silence to discover to whom my friend was talking presently i heard the voice of my cousin tom and i felt sure i confess my certainty that i understood the meaning of the situation how soon i said to myself has he found a use for the confidential to whom i introduced him i felt no doubt i it that he was arranging with tom how the story should be told in the and in the provincial press how england might be made to thrill from one end to the other by an account of this sudden catastrophe which had befallen a rising public servant and of the truly british pluck with which the awful consequences were borne intense curiosity nailed me to the spot i had no time to think of the peculiarity of my position as i listened with all my ears behind the heavy curtain even if i had tried to make my presence known the words which presently reached me would have stricken me dumb it seems impossible said tom  my little what was this i gave such a gasp that i thought it must

fling herself against it in the last assault she was ever to make and now that fatal day was come again  and see what it was bringing v chapter xix had been guilty of and all the other terrible crimes set forth in the twelve articles and her life was in s hands at last he could send her to the stake at once his work was finished now you think he was satisfied not at all what would his be worth if the people should get the idea into their heads that this of interested priests under the english lash had condemned and burned of arc of france that would be to make of her a holy martyr then her spirit would rise from her body s ashes a and sweep the english into the sea and along with it no the victory was not complete yet s guilt must be established by evidence which satisfy the people where was that evidence to be found there was only one person in the world who could furnish it  of arc herself she must condemn herself and in public  at least she must seem to do it but how was this to be managed weeks had been spent already in to get her to surrender  time wholly wasted what was to persuade her now torture had been threatened the fire had recollections op op arc been threatened what was left illness deadly fatigue and the sight of the fire the presence of the fire that was left now that was a shrewd thought she was but a girl after all and under illness and exhaustion subject to a girl s weaknesses yes it was thought she had said herself that under the bitter pains of the rack they would be able to a false confession from her it was a hint worth remembering and it was remembered she had furnished another hint at the same time that as soon as the pains were gone she would the confession that hint was also remembered she had herself taught them what to do you see first they must wear out her strength then frighten her with the fire second while the fright was on her she must be made to sign a paper but she would demand a reading of the paper they could not venture to refuse this with the public there to hear suppose that during the reading her courage should return  she would refuse to sign then very well even that difficulty could be got over they could read a short paper of no importance then slip a long and deadly one into its place and trick her into that yet there was still one other if they made her seem to that would free her from the death penalty they could keep her in a prison of the church but they could not kill her that would not answer for only her death would content mark twain the english alive she was a terror in a or out of it she had escaped from two already but even that difficulty could be managed would make promises to her in return she would promise to leave off the male dress he would his promises and that would so her that she would not be able to keep hers her lapse would condemn her to the stake and the stake would be ready these were the several moves there was nothing to do but to make them each in its order and the game was won one might almost name the day that the betrayed girl the most innocent creature in and the noblest would go to her pitiful death and the time was favorable  cruelly favorable s spirit had as yet no decay it was as sublime and as ever but her body s forces had been steadily wasting away in those last ten days and a strong mind needs a healthy body for its support the world knows now that s plan was as i have it to you but the world did not know it at that time there are sufficient indications that and all the other english chiefs except the highest one  the cardinal of  were not let into the secret also that only and on the french side knew the scheme sometimes i have doubted if even and knew the whole of it at first however if any did it was these two recollections of of arc it is usual to let the condemned pass their last night of life in peace but this grace was denied to poor if one may credit the of the time was into her presence and in the character of priest friend and secret of france and of england he spent some hours in her to do the only right and righteous thing  submit to the church as a good christian should and that then she would straightway get out of the of the dreaded english and be transferred to the church s prison where she would be used and have women about her for he knew where to touch her he knew how odious to her was the presence of her rough and profane english guards he knew that her voices had vaguely promised something which she interpreted to be escape rescue release of some sort and the chance to burst upon france once more and complete the great work which she had been of heaven to do also there was that other thing if her failing body could be further weakened by loss of rest and sleep now her tired mind would be dazed and drowsy on the morrow and in ill condition to stand out against threats and the sight of the stake and also be to traps and which it would be swift to detect when in

her worldly goods then she had her beauty she looked into the mirror and shuddered what would her husband do when he escaped from the prison walls it was the question she had asked herself a hundred times it was the question that had been suggested to her not an hour ago it would be a terrible day of reckoning he will kill me she muttered he has more pluck than this american he will kill me well and if he does what does it matter and then she took up the marked paper that the had left behind him and glanced carelessly through the paper until she came to the column that bore the trace of ink then she started back as if stung by an the marked passage told the world in general and the american capital in particular that lord francis the husband of the had lately arrived in new york by the fate of it was night time in the chief american police station before frank could find an opportunity for continuing his inquiries on his arrival he had quickly learned that mrs had not been arrested  that a had been received warning the officials to do nothing as their services were not required and for the moment the chief officer whom he consulted could tell him nothing more he had been advised to let matters take their course you see said the chief we can t do much at present sir the colonel is highly respected and a and until we have authority to interfere with his arrangements we must hold our hands you say that the boy that them is your son maybe it is so but still the lad is under the colonel s protection and we don t want to lend ourselves to an case it would be giving ourselves away but i tell you the boy belongs to me maybe he does and maybe he doesn t the word of colonel is as good as yours and while the lad is in his i don t see how we can help you if you take our advice you will let matters slide for awhile we will keep our eyes upon the household and if we find him taken out of the of the lady who says she is his aunt why then we will communicate with you and then will be the time for you to come upon the scene at present you will by arthur a pardon me sir  i should say my lord  you are what i may call a then you refuse to help me said frank angrily well that is not quite as i want to put it replied the officer of police but i guess it s about the true meaning don t be impatient sir many a bright undertaking has been ruined by too much impatience i know it isn t pleasant advice to anyone to be told to take things coolly but that s just the advice i would give to you let things slide a bit and when the time is ripe for action why then you shall know all about it at least you will give me the colonel s address can t say i can the colonel is a man of business and you will hear of him from in the proper quarter but it is no part of my duty to act as a you will run against him soon enough without my aid so sir or as i should say my lord if you are not busy i am and i must wish you good day with that the official bowed and walked away frank finding that nothing was to be done turned also and so the men separated in his hurry to leave england and reach the united states s husband had neglected to arm himself with letters of introduction and now he found the disadvantage of being in a strange city without a friend he walked down by o the fate of and fifth avenue but saw none but faces he had put up at one of the large new york hotels where he had given a false name he was not particularly anxious to make the acquaintance of the american a gentleman who was unique until copied in england some few years ago so far he had been able to preserve his as the police official who was a kind fellow at heart had promised to preserve the secret of his identity so at the delay he wandered about until to his great delight he received one evening a summons to attend at the you see i have not forgotten you said the official now i think we can set to work the boy you have been looking for has left the of the colonel  he is no longer in his care and where is he asked frank eagerly that is a my lord that for the moment i cannot answer was the reply the fact is we have made a bit of a mess of it a  a sharp one but still a  was put upon your business and he seems to have it what do you mean well look you here he was ordered to keep his eye on the lad and to report when the boy was removed from the colonel s by arthur a well he did his duty inasmuch as he gave us the notice the boy was off that has been reported right enough but he stopped don t you know where my son is at this moment said frank angrily well sir  i should say my lord  that is exactly what i cannot say our man rushed off to tell us the news of departure he would have done better had he followed up the track and what do you propose to do oh we have made the best of it	edith-wharton

chatter at the boys for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not all nature was wide awake and stirring now long of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near and a few came fluttering upon the scene tom stirred up the other and they all away with a shout and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each other in the shallow water of the white they felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water a current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their but this only gratified them since its going was something like burning the bridge between them and civilization they came back to camp wonderfully refreshed glad hearted

other and then each assumed a listening attitude there was a long silence profound and unbroken then a deep sullen boom came floating down out of the distance what is it exclaimed joe under his breath i wonder said tom in a whisper tain t thunder said in an awed tone thunder  hark said tom don t talk they waited a time that seemed an age and then the same muffled boom troubled the solemn hush let s

longer delay in new york would avail anything at least thought he might go home and meet his father and business associates and then if any glimmer of hope came again to his breast he could return and his search he indicated to that he would go with him and the one o clock train was decided upon he allowed his friend to send a to announcing the decision then he took a slight breakfast packed his things inquired at the other hotel office if any visitor had come or any mail sent to the general post to see if anything had been received there from the intelligence their marriage bond office

as warm as he could have expected this was the first time he had been separated o long from his father and the elder gentleman evinced his pleasure at seeing him again in no uncertain manner it was some minutes before he noticed the that mental distress had wrought in his son s face and he was easily satisfied with the explanation that the weather at sea had been rough the talk lasted until half an hour after the dinner was ended and then edward suggested that go without further delay to pay a call on his sweetheart i have not sent them word of your arrival as no doubt you thought i would do

quick eyes saw even before any words were exchanged that he was in no very joyful mood and they adapted themselves tc the situation the usual expressions of pleasure at greeting a wanderer were given as mr approached and took their hands and his answers were courteous enough still no spectator would have imagined from his manner that the younger of these ladies was to him and that the day set for their wedding was only three or four months distant mrs had a great deal of tact and she so managed the conversation that all went smoothly she made him talk of the things he had seen and alluded to

a selection talks on teaching literature can have for in the list of required books is that it may fairly be used for this careful work without prejudice to the of the piece as a whole in other words no objection exists to treating this especial selection first from the purely intellectual point of view to consider a play of shakespeare first would seem to me utterly wrong but this argument of is addressed to the reason rather than to the imagination and would therefore be so read beside the mere interpretation of difficult passages the pupil should be made to discern and to c we the value an

faculties of the scholar it the powers of reading and it may be made a continuous lesson in the nature and value of literary of study of literary i shall speak later here it is sufficient to point the necessity at once and the advantage the study of prose of dwelling on these vital thoughts so admirably expressed by the time the has been gone through with and a summary of each paragraph made in the class a skeleton is ready from which the argument may be considered as a whole la some schools students will be able to from an historical point of view and any intelligent boy to whom the is given for study should be able to judge of the logic of the plea if the speech is to justify its claim to being literature in the higher sense however it is not possible to stop with the intellectual study the question of what is better taken up it seems to me near the end of the course of secondary work if it is to come in at all but preparation for dealing with that question must come all along the line when has been studied for his political his argument up and examined the intellectual force of the parts and of the whole sufficiently considered then it is necessary to look at the na qualities of the work i would never set children to examine any piece of prose or verse tor any qualities until i was sure they understood what they are to look for if they are fo examine the for imaginative passages they must first know clearly what an imaginative passage is here the previous training of the is to be reckoned with some classes must be taught the significance of the term talks on teaching literature by having the passages pointed out to them and then others are so far advanced as to be able to discover them the thing i wish to is that when the simply intellectual study has far enough

now except the g een hands that came aboard this year this is rather an important matter outward bound or everything depends upon the officers for instance who will be captain asked with assumed indifference i shall of course replied with becoming modesty that s a settled matter i suppose yes without a doubt it is i may not ag ee to that suggested new convert you have already agreed to it you have promised to obey your but who are my i am one of them who appointed you i appointed myself i got up the chain i think i have just as much right to that place as  you have j i don t see it do you expect me to get up this i thing and then take a subordinate position demanded indignantly let members choose the captain that s the proper way perhaps they will choose neither one of us very well i will agree to serve under any fellow who is fairly elected when shall he be chosen asked who was so sure of a majority that he was disposed to adopt the suggestion when we have thirty links say  will agree to it the separated each to obtain as fast as he during the latter part of the day young america afloat the gale began to and at sunset its force was broken but the sea still ran fearfully high the fore course was shaken out and the ship filled away again plunging madly into the savage waves on sunday morning the gale had entirely subsided but the wind still came from the same quarter and the weather was cloudy the sea had its fury though the still rolled high and the ship had an ugly motion during the night the had been turned out of the the flying and had been set and the young america was making a course east south east sail ho shouted one of the crew on the after the watch was set where away demanded the officer of the deck over the lee bow sir was the report which came through the officers on duty the report created a sensation as it always does when a sail is seen for one who has not spent days and weeks on the broad expanse of waters can form only an inadequate idea of the companionship which those in one ship feel for those in another even while they are miles apart though the crew of the young america had been shut out from society only about three days they had already begun to realize this craving for association  this desire to see other people and be conscious of their existence after the severe gale through which they had just passed this sentiment was stronger than it would have been under other circumstances the ocean lashed into unwonted fury by the mad winds a fierce gale had been raging for full twenty four hours outward bound or and the tempest was suggestive of what the sailor most  with its long train of disaster  suffering and death it was hardly possible that such a terrible storm had swept the sea without carrying down some vessels with precious of human life the young america had safely ridden out the gale for all art could do to make her safe and strong had been done without regard to expense no owners had built her of poor and insufficient material or sent her to sea weakly and with officers the ship was heavily eighteen or twenty men would have been deemed a sufficient crew to work her and though her force consisted of boys they would average more than two of the muscle and skill of able there were other ships abroad on the vast ocean which could not compare with her in strength and and which had not one third of her working power on board no ship can absolutely defy tlie elements and there is no such thing as absolute safety in a voyage across the ocean but there is far less peril than people who have had no experience generally suppose the have been running more than a quarter of a century with the loss of only one ship and no lives in that one  a triumphant result achieved by strong ships with competent men to manage them poorly built ships short with officers unfit for their positions constitute the harvest of destruction on the ocean mr believed that the students of the academy ship would be as safe on board the young young america afloat america as they would on shore he had taken a great deal of pains to his theory to parents and though he often failed he often succeeded the young america had just passed through one of the of the year and in for the next three years she would hardly encounter a more terrific storm she had safely it the boys had behaved splendidly and not one of them had been lost or even injured by the trying exposure the principal s theory was thus far the watch to breakfast when the sail was discovered too far off to make her out the boys all manifested a deep interest in the distant wanderer on the sea mingled with a desire to know how the stranger had the gale many of them went up the into the tops and the spy glasses were in great demand do you make her out captain asked mr as he came up front bis breakfast and discovered the commander watching the stranger through the glass yes sir i can just make her out now her and have gone by the board and she has the union down hoisted at her replied the captain with no little excitement in his manner indeed exclaimed the teacher of as he took the glass you are right captain and you had better keep her away shall i speak to	isabella-lucy-bird

lacking in people who are born to a lesser station in life england demanded a queen and he invariably met the demand which shows that he knew something of political economy as well as of matrimony and as i see it being an american a man needs to know something of political economy to be a good ruler so many of our have acquired a merely knowledge of the science that we have had many object lessons of the of a merely knowledge of the subject to come right down to it i am a great admirer of henry at any rate he bad the courage of his heart convictions you really surprise me tapped never expected to find an the of so thoroughly in sympathy with kings and their needs oh as for that said i in america we are all kings and we are not without our needs matrimonial and otherwise only our courts are not quite so as henry s little axe but what was henry s attitude towards this extraordinary flight of s wrath said he was very much enraged and withdrew his declined to give our society the usual accounts of the functions his wives and worst of all has withdrawn himself and induced others to withdraw from the i was preparing for my special summer girls issue which is to appear in august on how men propose he and young and solomon and had agreed to dictate accounts of how they had done it on various occasions and queen elizabeth who probably had more proposals to the square minute than any other woman on record was to write the f the enchanted type writer d action this little plan which was really the idea of genius is entirely shattered by mrs s infernal interference nonsense said i don t despair f why don t you come out with a plain statement of the facts you forget my dear sir interposed that one of the j principles of as an institution is that excuses don t count it isn t a place for repentance so much as for and i might nine times a minute for forty years and would still have to suffer the penalty of the offence no there is nothing to be done but to begin my newspaper work again build up again the institution that has destroyed and bear my misfortunes like a true spirit spoken like a philosopher i cried and if i can help you my dear count upon me in anything you may do whether you start a monthly magazine  sporting weekly or a purely american sunday newspaper you are welcome to anything i can do for you the of you are very kind returned and if i need your services i shall be glad to avail myself of them just at present however my plans are so fully prepared that i do not think i shall have to call upon you with engaged to write twelve new stories to look after my tales of horror d his personal running my girls department and others too numerous to mention i have a sufficient supply of to fill up but if you feel like writing a few poems for me i may be able to use them as and they may help to make your name so well known in that next year i shall be able to print a worldly letter from you every week with a good chance of its proving popular and with this promise left me to get out the first number of the a sunday magazine for all taking him at his word i sent him the following poem a few days later the enchanted type writer locality i do we drift j souls whose every breath the doom of yet onward upward let it be through all the circles of the years  and then pray what alas tis all and never shall be stated yet we drift but i had intended this for one of oar leading magazines bnt it seemed so to lack the quality which is essential to a successful magazine poem in our sphere that i deemed it best to try it on mm vi the ally it was and will no doubt be considered even by those who are not too friendly towards myself a daring idea and it was all my own one night several weeks after the interview with just the idea came to me simultaneously with the first tapping of the keys for the evening upon the enchanted type writer it was s touch that summoned me from my my family were on the eve of departure for a month s rest from care and play in the mountains and i was looking forward to a period of very great loneliness but as and began his work upon the the enchanted type writer machine the great idea flashed across my mind and i resolved to play if for all it was worth jim said i as i approached the vacant chair in which he sat  for by this time the great and i had got upon terms of familiarity  jim said i got a very gloomy prospect ahead of me well why not he tapped where do you expect to have your gloomy prospects they can t very well be behind you said i you are this evening not at all he replied i have been spending the day with my old time samuel johnson and i am so with that i hardly know where i am from the point oi view you have expressed yourself well i am ill i retorted i don t know how far you are acquainted with home life but i do know that there is no the greater in the world than that of the man who is sick of home i am not an said but i must imitate you to the extent of saying	catharine-maria-sedgwick

scholars of professor s type are needed and welcome he not only in his writings upon the necessity and value of the literary method in such studies see the below but in his own person his meaning he is a student who makes past and present vivid by his interpretation of the raw stuff of facts and records the truth of the matter from mere literature and other essays by by permission of co  ive us the facts and nothing but the facts is the sharp of our age to its upon the face of it an eminently reasonable to tell the truth simply openly without is the first principle of all right dealing and have no license to be quit of it unquestionably they must tell us the truth or else get themselves among a very class of persons not often frankly named in polite society but the thing is by no means so easy as it looks the truth of history is a very complex and very matter it consists of things which are invisible as well as of things which are visible it is full of secret motives and of a chance of trivial and yet circumstances it is shot through with transient passions and broken here and there by what seem cruel accidents it cannot all be reduced to or newspaper or recorded statement and so it turns out when the actual test of experiment is made that the historian must have something more than a good conscience must be something more than a good man he must have an eye to see the truth and nothing but a very catholic imagination will serve to by his matter for him nothing less than keen and steady insight will n even illumination yield him the truth of what he looks upon even when he has seen the truth only half his work is done and that not the more difficult half he must then make others see it just as he does only when he has done that has he told the truth what an art of phrase and just selection must he have to take others into the light in which he stands their their ignorance their are to be overcome and driven in like a troop upon the truth the thing is infinitely difficult the skill and of it cannot be taught and so take another way which is easier they tell part of the truth  the part most to their taste or most suitable to their talents  and obtain readers to their liking among those of similar tastes and talents to their own we have our individual in history as in every other sort of literature and there are histories to every taste histories full of the details of personal biography histories that blaze with the of courts and with drum and trumpet and histories that run upon the but greater of the life of the people histories so and so lacking in mark or motive that they might have been set tip out of a dictionary without the of an author and histories so and violent in every judgment that no reader not of the historian s own party can stomach them histories of development and histories that speak only of politics those that tell nothing but what it is pleasant and interesting to know and those that tell nothing at all that one cares to remember one must be of a new and unheard of taste not to be suited among them all the trouble is after all that men do not invariably find the truth to their taste and will often deny it when they hear it and the historian has to do much more than keep his own eyes clear  he has also to catch and hold the eye of his reader tis a nice art as much intellectual as moral how shall he take the of his reader at unawares and get the facts down his throat along with the is there no way in which all the truth may be made to hold together in a narrative so strongly knit and so colored that no reader will have either the wish or the skill to tear its patterns and men will take it all and as it stands rather	edith-wharton
said one of the officials the man said the certainly not said the other and the first his statement but how can it be otherwise asked the or why was he so terrified at sight o the singing instrument of the law here he related the strange behaviour of the third stranger on entering the house can t understand it said the officer coolly all i know is that it is not the condemned man he s quite a different character from this one a fellow with dark hair and eyes rather good looking and with a musical bass voice that if the three strangers you heard it once you d never mistake as long as you lived why souls  twas the man in the what said the magistrate coming forward after inquiring particulars from the shepherd in the background haven t you got the man after all well sir said the he s the man we were in search of that s true and yet he s not the man we were in search of for the man we were in search of was not the man we wanted sir if you understand my way for twas the man in the chimney comer a pretty kettle of fish altogether said the magistrate you had better start for the other man at once the prisoner now spoke for the first time the mention of the man in the chimney comer seemed to have moved him as nothing else could do sir he said stepping forward to the magistrate take no more trouble about me the time is come when i may as well speak i have done nothing my crime is that the condemned man is my brother early this afternoon i left home at to tramp it all the way to to bid him farewell i was and called here to rest and ask the way when i opened the door i saw before me the very man my brother that i thought to see in the condemned cell at he was in this chimney comer and close to him so that the three strangers he could not have got out if he had tried was the who d come to take his life singing a song about it and not knowing that it was his victim who was close by joining in to save appearances my brother looked a glance of agony at me and i knew he meant don t reveal what you see my life depends on it i was so terror struck that i could hardly stand and not knowing what i did i turned and hurried away the s manner and tone had the stamp of truth and his story made a great impression on all around and do you know where your brother is at the present time asked the magistrate i do not i have never seen him since i closed this door i can testify to that for we ve been between ye ever since said the where does he think to fly to  what is his occupation he s a watch and clock maker sir a said a was a  a wicked rogue said the the wheels o and watches he meant no doubt said shepherd i thought his hands were for s trade well it appears to me that nothing can be gained by retaining this poor man in said the magistrate your business lies with the other unquestionably and so the little man was released off hand but he looked nothing the less sad on that account it the three strangers being beyond the power of magistrate or to out the written troubles in his brain for they concerned another whom he regarded with more solicitude than himself when this was done and the man had gone his way the night was found to be so far advanced that it was deemed useless to renew the search before the next morning next day accordingly the quest for the clever sheep became general and keen to all appearance at least but the intended punishment was cruelly to the and the sympathy of a great many country folk in that district was strongly on the side of the fugitive moreover his marvellous coolness and daring under the circumstances of the shepherd s party won their admiration so that it may be questioned if all those who made themselves so busy in exploring woods and fields and lanes were quite so thorough when it came to the private examination of their own and stories were afloat of a mysterious figure being occasionally seen in some old overgrown or other remote from roads but when a search was in any of these suspected quarters nobody was found thus the days and weeks passed without tidings in brief the bass man of the chimney corner was never some said that he went across the sea others that he did not but buried himself in the depths of a city at any rate the gentleman in grey never did his the three strangers morning s work at nor met an at all for business purposes the comrade with whom he had passed an hour of in the lonely house on the the grass has long been green on the graves of shepherd and his wife the guests who made up the party have mainly followed their to the tomb the baby

moment here i m sorry to say little or you would be in a worse place would you rather be here or in hell half asked half explained the reverend gentleman in the superior tone of one closing a discussion forever in hell replied opening his eyes with astonishment at the doubt mr jones was of all the that befall us in argument this us most he looked down at the little ignorant wretch and decided it would be useless to waste on him he fell instead into familiar conversation with him and then with the natural of youth confessed to bim that he had heard the at the next cell before he ventured to step off the chair and himself well but you ran a great risk too suppose he had not come into your cell  suppose he had been called away for a minute i should have been and no mistake said the boy with a shiver had proved no joke but i took my chance of that added i was to give them a besides if he had n t come it would all be over by now sir and all the better for me i know further

it and in three minutes forgot present pain past dangers and troubles to come the plan pursued with was to keep him at low water mark by lowering his diet without this so great was his natural energy and disposition to work that no excuse could have been got for him and at this period ne was too wise and self restrained to give any other but after a few days of unjust torture he began to lose hope and with hope patience away too and his enemy saw with grim satisfaction wild flashes of mad rage come every now and then to his eye harder and harder to suppress he will break out before long said to himself and then  robinson saw the game and a deep dark hatred of his enemy fought on the side of his prudence this bitter raging struggle of passions in the heart his soul more than had years of and petty all the vices of the old jail system are nothing compared with the effect of solitude on a heart with daily brooding on self is always but to brood on self and wrongs is to for madness murder and all crime between robinson and these there lay one little bit of  only one but it was a it is too late to mend one there was an official in the jail possessed of a large independent authority and paid robinson to take the side of humanity in the place this man was the of the national religion in the jail as was of the law robinson was too sharp at picking up everything in his way and had been too often in and their not to know that cruelty and injustice are contrary to the gospel and to the national religion which is in a great measure founded he therefore hoped and believed the of the jail would come between him and his if he could be made to understand the case now it happened just after the had thrown cold water on mr jones s little that robinson was pinned to the wall in the waistcoat and in the collar he had been thus some time when casting his despairing eyes around they lighted upon the comely respectable face of mr jones mr jones was looking gravely at the victim robinson devoured him with his eyes and his ears he heard him say in an  what is this has n t done his work at the was the answer then mr jones after taking another look at the gave a sigh and walked away robinson s hopes from this rose moreover part of his sermon next sunday against and robinson who had no conception the sermon was several years old looked on it as aimed at and his and as the of other and effective not long after this to his delight the visited him alone he seized this opportunity of securing the good man s interference in his favor he told him in glowing words the whole story of his and with a plain and eloquence appealed to him to make his chapel words good and come between the and their prey sir there are twenty or thirty poor fellows besides me that will bless your four bones night and day if you will but put out your hand and save us from being abused like dogs and nailed to the wall like and we are not sir we are men many a worse man is abroad than we that are here like wild beasts our bodies are men s bodies sir and our hearts are men s hearts you can t soften their hearts for they have n t such a thing about them but only just you open your month and your mind in right down earnest and you will shame them into treating us openly like human beings let them hate us and scorn us at bottom as they will we have no friend here sir but you not one

his valuable time he proceeded to make a further examination of the chain to his great satisfaction he found a place near the where the chain had been that is one link had been passed through another and secured with an iron bolt when the chain was slack he pulled out the bolt and the two ends dropped down into the water having performed this work he felt that his mission wa finished and that the steamer could go no farther down the sound having no other business to with the he concluded to push off especially as it by the adventures of a naval officer was new nearly daylight and n the of his way down to the cotton which could not be far off i have done it said he to himself as he pulled the painter through the ring and off the dug out from the steamer your pipe is out for the present mr the dug out shot off into the fog and mr almost stunned by the noise of the escaping steam of which the engineer relieved the when the boat stopped did not hear certain sounds which would have warned him of approaching danger indeed he was too well satisfied with himself after the important job he had done to think of anything except the fact that he had defeated another of mr s schemes as the dug out darted away from the steamer mr s ideas were suddenly thrown into confusion by an unexpected crash some object moving rapidly through the water had struck his frail craft on the side it was borne under and our was into the drink but immediately rescued his ideas from the confusion into which they had been thrown and without stopping to consider how the catastrophe had happened he struck out for the steamer which was not three distant from him the crash had been caused by the four oar boat in which had been in search of the dug out and his by the ob prisoner the steamer had stopped to permit him to come on board for he had given up all hope of recovering the prize he had lost just as backed out from the stem of the steamer the four oar boat was in under her quarter it was still very and there was not light enough to enable mr at once to decide what had happened he was looking at the steamer as he rounded in under her stem and the men sitting with their backs to the bow had not seen the dug out what s that demanded with an oath as he grasped the to recover his balance for the collision had given the larger boat a very sensible shock a boat sir replied the by this time

the dug out sir added another of the men whose eyes were better than those of his companion was there any one in her demanded mr i think i heard a man swimming and puffing in the water said who pulled the stroke oar we have on him then he can t be far off added with no little excitement at the prospect of his prisoner by the adventures of a naval officer the blood of ran cold in his veins at the imminent danger of his position he could hardly escape being taken now and handed over to mr whose hatred would subject him to every discomfort if not to death itself he trembled with apprehension as he saw at one glance the fate that there was hardly the shadow of a hope left but he climbed in as far as he could under the guard and himself under a brace the boat pulled up to the steamer s stem on which the captain and were now standing was awfully in earnest and he commenced a vigorous search for his prisoner in answer to a question from he stated what had happened and his own conviction that the yankee was on board of the steamer but mr could not find his prisoner he searched under the guard and over the guard but the s compact form was too closely away to be seen in the darkness he has ashore said the captain i don t believe it replied of course he has or you would have found him before now come on board we shall have the whole of them in a few days said i know he is about here somewhere added the confident come on board we can t stop here all day by the yankee ob we have something better to do continued impatiently i know he most be under the guard send me a lantern captain and i will soon find him nonsense i tell you he isn t there he has ashore before this time come here added in a tone so low that could hear him ru bet my life he is here answered the that was but he stepped on board th steamer as had requested the two talked together for a few moments during which the naval officer occasionally pointed to the boat seemed to understand him and to ia his decision for the men were ordered on board and the painter made fast could hardly believe his senses and still shivering with cold and with apprehension he whispered his prayer of that he had again been

was the parental tenderness with which he took by the hand every young man of merit covered him with his in the and led him forward at the bar in relation to his first great rival in eloquence richard henry lee he not only did ample justice to him on every occasion in public but defended his fame in private with all the zeal of a brother as is by an original correspondence between those two eminent men now in the hands of the author of colonel his next great rival he entertained and uniformly expressed the most exalted opinion and in the of as will be remembered paid a compliment to his eloquence at once so splendid so happy and so just that it will live forever the of that abound with the most and ardent of his respect for the talents and virtues of the other eminent gentlemen who were arrayed against him  mr mr mr even the justly great and fame of mr never from him in public at least one remark on the contrary the name of that gentleman who was then in france having been introduced into the of the for the purpose of the weight of his opinion mr henry spoke of him in the strongest and warmest terms not only of admiration but of affection  him our illustrious fellow citizen our enlightened and worthy our common friend the love of money and of fame are certainly base and degrading passions they have sometimes characters otherwise the most bright but they will find no advocate or in any virtuous bosom in relation to mr henry however we may be permitted to doubt whether the facts on which these so inconsistent with his general character by i o william are have not been and whether so much of them as is really true may not be fairly charged to the common account of human mr henry s great intellectual defect was his to this it was owing that he never possessed that admirable and vigorous of mind which turns promptly to everything to everything everything and by its operations each in its proper time and place and manner to the same cause it is to be ascribed that he never possessed that patient and that ready neat copious and command of details which forms so essential a part of the duties both of the and the lawyer hence too he did not avail himself of the progress of science and literature in his age he had not as he might have done those ample stores of various useful and curious knowledge which are so naturally expected to be found in a great man his library of which an has been furnished to the author was extremely small composed not only of a very few books but those too commonly odd volumes of science and literature he knew little or nothing more than was occasionally from conversation it is not easy to conceive what a mind like his might have achieved in either or both of these walks had it been properly trained at first or occupied in those long intervals of leisure which he threw away one thing however may be safely pronounced that had that mind of strength been either so trained or so occupied he would have left behind him some written monument compared with which even statues and pillars would have been but the of a day but he seems to have been of s opinion who is reported to have said of himself that he had read as much as other men he should have been as ignorant as they were mr henry s book was the great volume of human nature in this he was more deeply read than any of his countrymen he knew men thoroughly and hence arose his great power of persuasion his preference of this study is manifested by the following incident he met once in a with the late mr who although a great was infinitely more remarkable for his ignorance of men than mr henry was for that of books  what mr said he  still buying books yes said mr i have just by i william heard of a new work which i am extremely anxious to take my word for it said he mr we are too old to read books read men  they are the only volume that we can to advantage but mr henry might have both with infinite advantage not only to himself but to his country and to the world and that he did not do it may it is believed be fairly ascribed rather to the of his temper than the deliberate decision of his judgment henry s first case from sketches of the life and character of henry soon after the opening of the court the cause was called it stood on a writ of inquiry of no plea having been entered by the since the judgment on the the array before mr henry s eyes was now most fearful on the bench sat more than twenty the most learned men in the colony and the most capable as well as the critics before whom it was possible for him to have made his d but the court house was crowded with an overwhelming multitude and surrounded with an immense and anxious throng who not finding room to enter were to listen without in the deepest

afterward she took a seat by the fire and stared into the with an anxious look as though she saw therein a of the dismal prophecy her depression communicated itself to the rest of the company and shortly before ten the friends took their departure the idea of being alone seemed to cheer mrs and she accompanied her departing guests to the front door it was a comparatively thick fog yet not so bad but that the visitors might hope to reach their homes for some time mrs stood in the doorway at the top of the steps and shook hands with those who were going the who were old and chilly were too wise to venture outside on such a dreary night so mrs had the all to herself if you lose your ways she called out to the visitors come back you can tell the house by the red light she pointed to the of crimson glass behind which gas was burning i will keep alight for another hour the voices of thanks came back muffled by the fog but  nd george waited to hem  o s story more they walked upstairs to train s which was on the first floor the windows looked out on to a back garden wherein grew a few trees so that the prospect was not cheering but on this night the faded crimson curtains were drawn the fire was lighted and a round table in the middle of the apartment was spread for supper on one side a door led to s bedroom on the other side was the room wherein george was to sleep as the fire light played on the old fashioned furniture and on the mellow colors of curtains and carpet rubbed his hands it is rather quaint he said and lighted the lamp not such a palace as your in duke street said stretching his long legs on the covered sofa one must suffer in the cause of art said train putting the shade on the lamp i am picking up excellent types here what do you think there s plenty of material growled getting out his pipe don t smoke yet george interposed train glancing at the clock we must have supper first after that we can smoke till eleven and then we must go to bed you keep early hours here i don t mrs asked me particularly to be in bed at eleven why started and looked hard at his friend i don t know but she did is it an understood thing that you retire at that hour train shook his head and drew in his chair by no means i have sat up till two before now but on this night mrs wants the house to b q x the yellow respectable and therefore asked me to retire early perhaps it s on account of you old man here he smiled in an amused manner she hopes to get you as a i wouldn t come here for the world retorted with quite unnecessary violence why not have some tongue thanks responded george passing his plate because i don t like the house and i don t care for mrs why did you advise me to come here then asked train pouring out a glass of well you wanted something in the style of and this was the only place i knew how did you know about it for a moment and then fastened his eyes on his plate i lived here once he said in a low voice dear me gasped train what an extraordinary thing why so one must live somewhere but you didn t like mrs she was not here then who was here my grandfather on the mother s side that s fifteen years ago looked at the handsome moody face of his friend i never knew you had a grandfather he said at last do you know anything at all about me asked no now i come to think of it i don t i met you three years ago at mrs ward s house and we have been friends ever since acquaintances rather men are not friends until they become confidential with one another well train george pushed back his chair and wipe s story his mouth to night i intend to turn you from a mere acquaintance into a friend i shall be delighted said train rather bewildered won t you have more supper shook his head lighted his pipe and stretched himself on the sofa train being curious to know what he had to say was on the point of joining him but he was yet hungry so could not bring himself to leave the table he therefore continued his supper and as seemed to

the mud and the as fast as my weary legs would bear me i was too cold and miserable to refuse any shelter and i had no doubt that for the sake of one of my gold pieces the or peasant who lived in this strange situation would shut his eyes to whatever might be suspicious in my presence or appearance by e as i approached it became more and more wonderful to me that any one should live there at all for the grew worse rather than better and in the occasional of i could make out that the water lay in glimmering pools all round the low dark cottage from which the light was breaking i could see now that it shone through a small square window as i approached the gleam was suddenly obscured and there in a yellow frame appeared the round black outline of a man s head peering out into the darkness a second time it appeared before i reached the cottage and there was something in the stealthy manner in which it peeped and away and peeped once more which filled me with surprise and with a certain vague apprehension so cautious were the movements of this and so singular the position of his watch house that i determined in spite of my misery to see something more of him before i trusted myself to the shelter of his roof and indeed the amount of shelter which i might hope for was not very great for as i drew softly nearer i could see that the light from within was beating through at by ic the salt several points and that the whole cottage was in the most crazy state of for a moment i paused thinking that even the salt marsh might perhaps be a safer resting place for the night than the of some desperate for such i that this lonely dwelling must be the however had covered the moon once more and the darkness was so black that i felt that i might a little more closely without fear of discovery walking on i approached the little window and looked in what i saw reassured me vastly a small wood fire was in one of those old fashioned country and beside it was seated a strikingly handsome young man who was reading earnestly out of a fat little book he had an oval face with long black hair in a and there was something of the poet or of the artist in his whole appearance the sight of that refined face and of the warm yellow beat upon it was a very cheering to a cold and traveller i stood for an instant gazing at him and noticing the way in which his full and somewhat loose fitting lower lip quivered by uncle continually as if he were repeating to himself that which he was reading i was still looking at him when he put his book down upon the table and approached the window catching a glimpse of my figure in the darkness he called out something which i could not hear and waved his hand in a gesture of welcome an instant later the door flew open and there was his thin tall figure standing upon the threshold with his skirts flapping in the wind my dear friends he cried peering out into the gloom with his hand over his eyes to screen them from the salt laden wind and driving sand i had given you up i thought that you were never coming i ve been waiting for two hours for answer i stepped out in front of him so that the light fell upon my face i am afraid sir said i but i had no time to finish my sentence he struck at me with both hands like an angry cat and springing back into the room he the door with a crash in my face the swiftness of his movements and the of his gesture were in such singular contrast with his appearance that i was struck by tiie salt marsh speechless with surprise but as i stood there with the door in front of me i was a witness to something which filled me with even greater astonishment i have already said that the cottage was in the last stage of amidst the many and cracks through which the light was breaking there was one along the whole of the side of the door which gave me from where i was standing a view of the further end of the room at which the fire was burning as i gazed then i saw this man in front of the fire furiously with both his hands in his bosom and then with a spring he disappeared up the chimney so that i could only see his shoes and half of his black as he stood upon the at the side of the grate in an instant he was down again and at the door who are you he cried in a voice which seemed to me to be thrilling with some strong emotion i am a traveller and have lost my way there was a pause as if he were thinking what course he should pursue by uncle you ul find little here to tempt you to stay he at last i am weary and spent sir and surely you will not refuse me shelter i have been wandering for hours in the salt marsh did you meet anyone there he asked eagerly no stand back a little from the door this is a wild place and the times are a man must take some precautions i took a few steps back and he then opened the door sufficiently to allow his head to come through he said nothing but he looked at me for a long time in a very searching manner what is your name louis

reader to itself but in all the plays of shakespeare and in the fiction of moat of the masters the opportunities are ample the supreme test of any subject which is to be given to students in their written work is whether it is one upon which it is reasonable to suppose they can and will have thought which is individual and therefore original if it were necessary to make nice distinctions between that which is and that which is not part of the study of literature as an art one must go much further than this the writing of however is part of the side of the work the main thing is talks on teaching literature to be sure that it is not dwelt upon more than is necessary and that it is within the range of the personal experience oi the student if teachers feel compelled to set their classes to write formal and lifeless on topics such as too often appear in examination papers they will do well to keep io mind that this is not the study of literature but a process which the power of appreciation and intelligent comprehension by mechanical imitation x in connection with the subject of this chapter i may mention a device which may not be without practical value in secondary school it a means of discovering how well the is succeeding in grasping general principles and in making actual application of them while at the same time it should impress upon him the y v fact that he is not studying merely a series of but the nature and qualities of literature on an examination paper in year english at the of was put this test it is assumed that the student never read tlie following extract state w hat seem its excellent points a of li of c ot to this was added a brief extract from some standard author the opening statement was made in order that the class should understand the to he not from any required reading but from some work entirely the points of excellence only were asked for order to fix attention on merits and indirectly to strengthen so far as might be the perception of the importance of looking in literature for merits rather than for defects it is undoubtedly proper that scholars should be able to perceive defects but this power is beat trained by them to be sensitive and to the necessities of time made it impossible to put upon the papers of which i am speaking of much length and the class were told that not was expected in comment upon the thought expressed the of tlie question that of seeing how the y were able to apply such principles as they had learned was also frankly put they were warned against and statements then they were left to their own devices the results were all suggestive and of course were of widely varying degrees of merit a few may be given chosen i confess from those more interesting on one paper were the opening lines of the second book of  paradise lost high oil a throne of state which tar tha of and of ind or where the gorgeous east with richest hand showers on her kings and gold exalted sat see page talks on literature among the were these of tbe of this selection we may say that it is good the selection of words ia especially forcible gorgeous east and richest hand are extremely so but what i consider a fine use of a word is the word here we can see the early inhabitants of the rich of the east the inhabitants ignorant of the value of their wealth throwing it around as we would the pebbles on a beach the thought and the imagination are good we can see before us the vividly picture there sits satan high above his surrounding in such rich and dazzling magnificence that it even the richest kings of the richest part of the world the best point of the consists iu placing the description first and not tbe thought until the last hue thus keeping the reader in suspense and causing careful attention to be put on all the sentence the words high throne royal and exalted combine to bring out the thought of satan a majesty the thought of unbounded wealth ia brought out by tbe use of the word showers in tbe third line the author is able to give a much more vivid idea o the magnificence of the throne by letting us the throne to suit ourselves than by giving a detailed description and leaving nothing to the imagination even the materials are only the whole idea being one of wealth and splendor the choice of words is one of the best points in the of the quotation the arrangement also adds emphasis all the descriptions of the throne are so vivid that the mind is deeply impressed by the splendor and richness of the throne the gorgeous east ia expressive of wealth and beauty with this ai of words the piece becomes veiy striking and the choice of the strongest is shown too in with the whole sentence whereas on the other hand if any other arrangement been much of the force of these words would have been lost the of the extract is to describe the great wealth and beauty with which satan is surrounded the writer must lave a very vivid imagination to describe such a scene of wealth and beauty the first word high appeals directly to the imagination and immediately gives the impression of power these answers were written by boys had not been called upon to do anything of

not a the principal was in this state of suffering upon anguish when the professor of greek and latin came on board mr tried to think that nothing had happened but it was impossible if any one had been lost the s flag would be at half mast or some other signal would have been made mr s face looked like death itself only his brow was contracted and his lips were compressed as though anger and sorrow were combined in his expression what has happened mr demanded the principal more emotion than any one on board had ever before observed in his manner i am to say mr that an unpleasant event has occurred on board of tjie the professor began very solemnly  i i l young america in holland and i feared if gasped mr who was it  the captain  captain groaned mr striking his bewildered head with both hands good heaven i am responsible for this what is the matter mr demanded the astonished professor what did you say about captain asked the principal catching at the straw which the learned gentleman s question seemed to hold out to him i prefer to speak to you alone about it mr added the professor glancing at the group of officers and that were gathering around him i will endeavor to control my emotions in stating this unpleasant business mr apparently happy to have even a moment s from the grief and gloom must follow the sad intelligence of the loss of captain led the way to the professors cabin now sir what is it let me know the worst exclaimed the principal upon the sofa like a man whose strength had all been taken from him i have been it for many long and weary it repeated the confused what sir that the had suffered severely in the storm replied the principal impatiently you have come to tell that captain was lost overboard and mr heaved a long sigh ok no sir protested mr didn t you say th it a very unpleasant had happened on demanded tlie principal i did but it was not the loss of the captain who was it asked mr catching his breath in the of his anxiety i really don t understand you sir said t ie learned gentleman astonished and confounded by what he regarded as the singular conduct of the has any one been lost overboard from the demanded mr in a loud tone for he was impatient under the manner of the professor no sir no one that i am aware of that you are aware of exclaimed mr sternly of course if any one had been lost i should have heard of it answered mr who did not quite like the tone of the principal then the officers and crew are all safe  are they are sir  all safe thank god i ejaculated mr heartily an awfully heavy load removed from his mind i have come on board sir to make a complaint against the captain of the this is the unpleasant business which brings me here added the learned gentleman decidedly indeed but even this disagreeable as it was came as a relief to the heart of paul s best friend who had received a terrible shock from the confused state young america in holland and jl merit of the professor yet it was strange that any one should have a complaint to against paul who had always been noble and manly gentle and yesterday just before the storm came on mr was witli the greek class continued mr word came to him that his was required on deck he asked my permission to go on deck as i could not see the necessity of his leaving the class before the lesson was finished i refused to give him permission did be leave then not then but half an hour later another message came to him and he left contrary to my orders and contrary to my protest added professor indignant as he his wrongs what was the message that came the second time asked mr l mildly i do not remember precisely what it was  i am not in sea terms but i do remember that mr left the class contrary to my express order not contented with this he called all hands and broke the school when there was no need of it such conduct is utterly of school discipline and  excuse me mr but as to day is sunday i must hearing any more of your complaint until to morrow continued mr rising from his i desire to have this question settled before i resume my position in the said tlie professor cut by the apparent coolness of the principal c h a i will hear what captain has to say about it sir exclaimed the learned in am i to understand that you are not satisfied with tlie truth of my statement by no means i wish to hear from captain his excuse for leaving the class i am not able to determine whether it was satisfactory i have already determined that question myself i think i observed to you that there was not a sufficient excuse for his leaving the class i will the discussion of the matter till tomorrow replied mr i do not object to the delay sir but i do object to having any of the statements of the pupil those i have made do you wish me to condemn him without a hearing i do not wish you to condemn him at all i simply ask to be sustained in the discharge of my duty as a teacher i will hear what e you have to say to morrow mr very well sir but you must allow me to remain on board of the ship until to morrow for i cannot return to the till this unpleasant matter has been adjusted	isabella-lucy-bird

pathetic events recorded in history than this weeping helpless praying holding their lighted candles and kneeling on the pavement beneath the prison walls of the old fortress and it was so all the way thousands upon thousands upon their knees and stretching far down the distances thick sown with the faint yellow candle flames like a field with golden flowers but there were some that did not kneel these were the english soldiers they stood elbow to elbow on each side of s road and walled it in all the way and behind these living knelt the multitudes by and by a frantic man in priest s garb came wailing and and tore through the crowd and the barrier of soldiers and flung himself on his knees by s cart and put up his hands in crying out of arc f o forgive forgive it was and forgave forgave him

wholly apart and to signify the church s of her and she sat there in her loneliness waiting in patience and resignation for the end addressed her now he had been advised to read the form of her to her

never thought of his desertion of her she never remembered that it was of art i because he was an in grate that she was here to die a miserable death she remembered only that he was her king that she was his loyal and loving subject and that his enemies had his cause with evil reports and false charges and he not by to defend himself and so in the very presence of death she forgot her own troubles to all in her hearing to be just to him to believe that he was good and noble and sincere and not in any way to blame for any acts of hers neither them nor urging them but being wholly clear and free

from the fortress of the her promise was she had raised the siege of the seven months was ended the thing which the first of france had called impossible was accomplished in spite of all that the king s ministers and war could do to prevent it this little country maid of seventeen had carried her immortal task through and had done it in four days good news travels fast sometimes as well as bad by the time we were ready to start homeward by the bridge the whole city of was one red flame of and the heavens blushed with satisfaction to see it and the and of cannon and the of bells surpassed by great odds anything that even had attempted before in the way of noise when we arrived  well there is no describing that why those acres of people that we through shed enough to raise the river there was not a face in the glare of those fires that t mark twain tears streaming down it and if s feet had not been protected by iron they would have kissed them off of her welcome welcome to the maid of that was the cry i heard it a hundred thousand times welcome to our maid some of them it no other girl in all history has ever reached such a summit of glory as of arc reached that day and do you think it turned her head and that she sat up to enjoy that delicious music of homage and applause no another girl would have done that but not this one that was the greatest heart and the simplest that ever beat she went straight to bed and to sleep like any tired child and when the people she was wounded and would rest they shut off all passage and traffic in that region and stood guard themselves the whole night through to see that her were not disturbed they said she has given us peace she shall have peace herself all knew that that region would be empty of english next day and all

dawn we were in the saddle and away toward to report to the king that was a march which would have turned any one s head but s we moved between ranks of grateful country people all the way they crowded about to touch her feet her horse her and they even knelt in the road and kissed her horse s prints the land was full of her praises the most illustrious chiefs of the church wrote to the king the maid comparing her to the saints and heroes of the bible and warning him not to let ingratitude or other injustice hinder or the divine help sent through her one might think there was a touch of

conclusion other than that they were the desperate of some body political or b that little square box  otherwise who intended to sacrifice themselves their fellow passengers and the ship in one great the which i had seen one of them pour into the box formed no doubt a or train for it i had myself heard a sound come from it which might have from some delicate piece of machinery but what did they mean by their allusion to to night could it be that they contemplated putting their horrible design into execution on the very first evening of our voyage the mere thought of it sent a cold shudder over me and made me for a moment superior even to the agonies of sea sickness i have remarked that i am a physical coward i am a moral one also it is seldom that the two defects are united to such a degree in the one character i have known many men who were most sensitive to bodily danger and yet were distinguished for the independence and strength of their minds in my own case however i regret to say that my quiet and retiring habits had a nervous dread of doing anything remarkable or making myself conspicuous which exceeded if possible my fear of personal peril an ordinary mortal placed under the circumstances in which i now found myself would have gone at once to the captain confessed his fears and put the matter into his hands to me however constituted as i am the idea was most the thought of becoming the observed of all cross questioned by a stranger and confronted with two desperate in the character of a de that little square box was hateful to me might it not by some remote possibility prove that i was mistaken what would be my feelings if there should turn out ta be no grounds for my accusation no i would pro i would keep my eye on the two and dog them at every turn anything was better than the possibility of being wrong then it struck me that even at that moment some new phase of the conspiracy might be developing itself the nervous excitement seemed to have driven away my attack of sickness for i was able to stand up and lower myself from the boat without any return of it i staggered along the deck with the intention of descending into the cabin and finding how my acquaintances of the morning were occupying themselves just as i had my hand on the i was astonished by receiving a hearty slap on the back which nearly shot me down the steps with haste than dignity is that you said a voice which i seemed to recognise bless me i said as i turned round it can t be dick i why how are you old man this was an unexpected piece of luck in the midst of my dick was just the man i wanted kindly and shrewd in his nature and prompt in his actions i should have no difficulty in telling him my suspicions and could rely upon his sound sense to point out the best course to pursue since i was a little lad in the second form at dick had i that little square box been my adviser and protector he saw at a glance that something had gone wrong with me he said in his kindly way what s put you about you look as white as a sheet mai de eh no not that altogether said i walk up and down with me dick i want to speak to you give me your arm supporting myself on dick s frame i along by his side but it was some time before i could muster resolution to speak have a cigar said he breaking the silence no thanks said i dick we shall be all to night that s no reason against your having a cigar how said dick in his cool way but looking hard at me from under his shaggy eyebrows as he spoke he evidently thought that my intellect was a little gone no i continued it s no laughing matter and i speak in sober earnest i assure you i have discovered an infamous conspiracy dick to destroy this ship and every soul that is in her and i then proceeded and in order to lay before him the chain of evidence which i had collected there dick i said as i concluded what do you think of that and above all what am i to do to my astonishment he burst into a hearty fit of laughter i d be frightened he said if any fellow but you had told me as much you always had a way ham tha t little ua re box of discovering nests i like to see the old traits breaking out again do you remember at school how you swore there was a ghost m the long room and how it turned out to be your own reflection in the mirror why man he continued what object would any one have in destroying this ship we have no great political guns aboard on the contrary the majority of the passengers are americans besides in this sober nineteenth century the most stop at including themselves among their victims depend upon it you have misunderstood them and have mistaken a or something equally innocent for an infernal machine nothing of the sort sir said i rather you will learn to your cost i fear that i have neither exaggerated nor a word as to the box i have certainly never before seen one like it it contained delicate machinery of that i am convinced from the way in which the men handled it and spoke of it you d make out every packet of goods to be a said dick if that is to be your only test	edith-wharton
sat on the floor together to entertain her she was pleased to be in the most sunny mood imaginable and responded to our most graciously with truly feminine preference however she bestowed most of her attention upon the man she is a more every day and she certainly has her father s eyes i compared them this afternoon september the reading room seems really at last to be coming into being i have found a place for it it is a kind of square box over the post office but with furniture and pictures it can be made rather attractive i have made out a list of and sent to boston for framed photographs for the walls to day i went to talk over the plan with the mill was fragrant with its sweet smell and daniel was as dusty as a miller as i stood in the doorway waiting for him to come down from the wheel where he was doing something or other about the i fell to humming the old rhyme we sang as children when we went by the mill  miller miller how many bags of wheat yoa stole one of wheat and one of ton miller yon die that is n t very polite daniel said coming up behind me before i knew he had left his perch september i turned and greeted bim repeating the last line  ton naughty miller yon must die i i suppose i must he assented but it won t be for stealing miss i love the old mill with its great beams and its continual sound of dashing water and the of the grinding away at the com like an monster that can never have enough the smell of the meal too is so pleasant and even the abundant dust is so clean and fresh it seems to belong there the mellow light through the dim windows and the shadows hiding in every comer have always from childhood appealed to my imagination i find there always a soothing and serene mood i want your advice i said so as not to follow it he demanded that s what women generally want of advice i assured him i was ready to follow his advice if it were good and so we talked about the reading room i told him it seemed to me that if it was to go on properly it should have a head somebody to manage it and be responsible for the way in which it was carried on but you will do that yourself he said i answered that it must be a man for it was nonsense to think of a woman s running a reading room for men he looked at me for a moment with his droll grin and then he was pleased to say that for a woman i had a remarkable amount of common sense i thanked him for the compliment to my sex and then asked if he would undertake the business and promise not to the readers out the way he did the prayer the of a saint i m not the sort of person you want he answered at my allusion to the fire question i ve sense enough to know that without being a woman why don t you ask tom i confessed that i had thought of tom but  and there i stuck for i could hardly tell the how i thought gossip had already said enough about tom and myself without my giving folk any more to talk about i don t know what that bnt means he re marked grinning more than ever as if he did know perfectly anyway there s nobody in town who could do it so well all the men and boys like him and he has a level head he s the only one of the young fellows that s been to college and he ought to know more about books than any of the rest of them besides he needs something to take up his mind i felt the was right and i began to ask myself whether my personal feelings should be allowed to count in such a matter still i could hardly make up my mind to take the of putting tom at the head of a reading room i had started if nothing else were to be considered i did not want my connection with the plan to be too prominent and gossip about tom would be just the thing to keep my name always to the front i hope you are sensible enough to do one thing daniel went on and that is to have everybody who uses the room pay for it it need n t be much but they respect it and themselves more if they pay something and it give them the right to i don t want them to i returned oh nobody cares much for anything he can t mm september about was his reply with a laugh but really they are twice as likely to if you pay for everything than if they help that s the way we are made i told him that he was an old but i saw in a moment he was right about the value that would be put on a thing which was paid for if the men feel they are helping to support the reading room they will take a good deal more interest in it tom will manage them all right the con declared he let them just enough and make them so contented they ll think they re having their own way while he s going ahead just the way he thinks best he s the only man for the place perhaps he is and indeed the more i think about it the more i see the is right it would certainly be good for tom and that is a good deal i wonder what	charles-dickens
were all but one men who had hardly reached their middle age and who in any other army might have been considered fortunate if they had gained the command of a regiment but the continuous wars and the open system by which rules of yielded to merit had opened up a rapid career to a successful soldier each carried his curved cocked hat under his arm and now leaning upon their sword they fell into a little circle and eagerly among themselves you are a man of family are you not asked my i am of the same blood as the de and the so i had understood well then you will understand that there have been some changes in this country when i tell you that those men who by ic the under the emperor axe the greatest in the country have been the one a waiter the next a wine the next a of barrels and the next a house painter those are the trades which gave us and as i was no names had ever thrilled me as those did and i eagerly asked him to point me out each of these famous soldiers h there are many famous soldiers in the room said he besides he added twisting his moustache there may be junior officers here who have it in them to rise higher than any of them but there is to the right i saw a man with close red hair and a large square face such as i have seen upon an english prize we call him peter the and sometimes the red lion in the army said my companion he is said to be the man in the army though i cannot admit that he is than some other people whom i could mention still he is undoubtedly a very good leader and the general next him i asked why does he carry his head all upon one side l by uncle that is general and he carries his head upon his left shoulder because he was shot through the neck at the siege of st d acre he is a like myself and i fear that he gives some ground to those who accuse my countrymen of being a little and but smiles you are mistaken i thought that perhaps something which i had said might have amused i thought that possibly he meant that really were instead of being as i contend the race in france  an opinion which i am always ready to in any way which may be suggested but as i say is a very man though occasionally perhaps a trifle the next man is i looked with interest upon the hero of who had taken command upon the one occasion when napoleon s heart and spirit had failed him he was a man i should judge who would shine rather in war than in peace for with his long goat s face and his brandy nose he looked in spite of his golden oak leaves just such a long by the legged vulgar foul mouthed old soldier as every room can show he was an older man than the others and his sudden promotion had come too late for him to change he was always the of the guard under the hat of the french yes yes he is a rough fellow said in answer to my remark he is one of those whom the emperor had to warn that he wished them to be soldiers only with the army he and and with their big boots and their were too much for the s drawing room at the there is also the dark man with the heavy face heaven help the english village that he finds his quarters in it was he who got into trouble because he broke the jaw of a priest who could not find him a second bottle of and that is i suppose yes that is with the black whiskers and the red thick lips and the brown of egypt upon his face he is the man for me my word when you have seen him in front of a of light cavalry with his tossing and by uncle his flashing you would not wish to see anything finer i have known a square of break and scatter at the very sight of him in egypt the emperor kept away from him for the would not look at the little general when this fine and was before in my opinion is the better light cavalry officer but there is no one whom the men will follow as they do and who is the stern looking man leaning on the oriental sword oh that is he is the most obstinate man in the world he with the emperor the handsome man beside him is is leaning against the tent pole i looked with interest at the extraordinary face of this adventurer who after starting with a and a in the ranks was not contented with the of a but passed on afterwards to grasp the of a king and it might be said of him that his fellows he gained his throne in spite of napoleon rather than by his aid any man who looked at his singular pronounced features the of which pro by the room claimed his half spanish origin must have read in his flashing black eyes and in that huge nose that he was reserved for a strange destiny of all the fierce and men who surrounded the emperor there was none with greater gifts and none also whose he more than those of and yet fierce and as these men were having as boasted fear neither of god nor of the devil there was something which thrilled or them in the pale smile or black frown of the little man who ruled them for as i watched them there suddenly over the assembly a start and	edith-wharton

i am sure and you must have a great deal of patience till i get a little used to things gray could control his tongue but not his thoughts and he wondered more than ever how this mother s girl this father s pet had strayed so far from reserve and duty as to have come gone to her present pass but he shook off these reflections with all the force he could muster he had not only to forgive he must try also to forget chapter xiv good night mrs thoroughly under the influence of her husband agreed with but slight resistance to the departure of the young couple a little in advance of us as she put it for the exact date she was to follow was not yet arranged she troubled mr gray when he came for his good by covert allusions to the natural desire of young married people to be away from their elders where they could enjoy with absolute freedom the society of each other she had once been of their age she told them and her memory was good ah they should make the most of their youth and their love for years crept on and there would be an end to all things earthly if only their affection grew brighter with the lapse of time as hers and her husband s had done they could ask for nothing sweeter and to this play of words and lent themselves with whatever was necessary to deceive while the sober face of colonel with its new lines of pain and care even when it encouraged the deception good night at parting bent above the sweet countenance of his mother in law and kissed her reverently on the forehead at which she drew him down and pressed her lips to his cheek declaring at the last moment that could not be in better hands than his and that he had her entire confidence and love here is purse and yours said colonel pressing it into gray s hand when they retired to be for a few minutes alone and here is a letter of credit that you will use at your discretion say nothing i pray you about this matter but consider yourself as i told you before one of my family and entitled to a full share of all i have i also want you to know that i like you more than i ever dreamed i should and that there has been a weight lifted from my heart since i have found to what a true man the happiness of my child is nothing was to be gained by any reply to this speech except a simple thank you colonel and an hour later the mail bore the wedded pair rapidly toward the channel gray was not surprised because his wife curled herself into a corner of the and wept softly during most of the journey she had enough to weep for god knew and tears he had often heard were a blessing to women in trouble the kindest thing was to arrange her about her with a gentle hand and leave her to herself at the steamer pier he assisted her to the ladies cabin glad to remember that the rules prevent men and women occupying that part of the boat together and gave special directions to the love gone astray with a good fee to make madame as comfortable as possible then he went into the men s cabin and lighting a cigar passed the time before reaching france in contemplating his future in wreaths of smoke when he went for his wife on the arrival of the steamer at he found that she had dried her tears for the in the experience of a new form of discomfort for which they offered no relief she had suffered from and presented a most spectacle as women are apt to do on such occasions she clung closer to her husband as he took her to the train and shivered as the wintry wind blew around the corners with a suggestion of fine snow in the air when the train started she began to talk referring to her illness on the boat and showing her feminine nature by remarks in relation to her appearance to which he gave suitable replies the was also occupied by another couple a young man and woman whom no one could doubt were on the first day of their wedding trip the young woman close to her husband and laughed when he tucked the about her feet and felt occasionally to see if her hands were as warm as they should be their conversation which did not for an instant was conducted in so low a tone that the man s lips almost and once or twice quite touched his companion s cheek happiness the purest and sweetest that is given to the children of men was theirs and the couple who sat in the other corner felt the contrast in all its intensity this girl thought might also be leaving good night her father and mother for the first time but in the overpowering love for her wedded mate she could feel her heart throb with joy even after that parting in the new arms to which she was going nature would teach her to forget for the those that had so long been her refuge against the breast of this lover she would find compensation for the one which had nursed her baby lips with this champion to fight her battles she could spare the father who had guarded her from every danger since her little feet took their first step and i reflected i what have i thrown away what have i gained in exchange for all this if only the past could come again and i could see these things as i see them now thought of it all too he saw as in a	arthur-conan-doyle

quickly it is in a state of suppressed revolt replied with satisfaction is not at all popular and may be from his chair at any moment then they will recall their queen said no answered slowly shaking his head they will elect in london what exclaimed in a fiery tone does the country still incline to the republic the country at large does not but is in possession of the army and all the power is therein the army is devoted to and if he desires to be president the army will make him so can we not gain mm to our side there is every chance of our doing so according to the cardinal replied but your majesty will hear all to morrow i will go cried the princess madame you will accompany me and when i am face to face with we can some measure by which to gain to our side if your majesty can do that all will be in our favor cannot stand against the power of the army but if you fail fail echoed with a laugh of scorn i did not risk my life and liberty in to fail at the last moment chapter the

had not had a thought to spare either upon the weather or our hunger now we began to look round and our waist and ask who was hit and who was spared i was glad to see jim with his face all blackened with powder standing on my right rear leaning on his he saw me looking at him and shouted out to know if i were hurt all right jim i answered i fear tm here on a wild goose chase said he gloomily but it s not over yet by god til have him or he ll have me he had so much on his wrong had poor jim that i really believe that it had turned his head for he had a glare in his eyes as he spoke that was hardly human he was always a man that took even the shadow on the land i a little thing to heart and since had left him i am sure that he was no longer his own master it was at this of the fight that we saw two single fi ts which they tell me were common enough in the battles of old before men were trained in masses as we lay in the hollow two came along the ridge right in fix nt of us riding as hard as could rattle the first was an english his face right down on his horse s mane with a french an old grey headed fellow thundering behind him on a big black mare our set up a as they came flying on for it seemed shame to see an run like that but as they swept across our front we saw where the trouble lay the had dropped his sword and was while the other was pressing him so close that he could not get a weapon at last stung maybe by our he made up his mind to chance it his eye fell on a lance beside a dead frenchman so he his horse to let the other pass and off cleverly enough he hold of it but the other was too for him and was on him like a shot the thrust up i ith the lance but the other it and him through the shoulder blade it was all done in an instant and the frenchman his horse up the showing his teeth at us over his shoulder like a dog that was one to them but we one for us presently they had pushed forward a line whose fire was towards the on our right and left rather than on us but we sent out two companies of the th to keep them in check it was v i th great shadow hear the kind of noise that they made for both sides were using the rifle an officer stood among the french  a tall lean man with a mantle over his shoulders  and as our fellows came forward he ran out between the two parties and stood as a would with his sword up and his head back i can see him now with his lowered eyelids and the kind of sneer that he had upon his face on this the of the who was a fine well grown lad ran forward and drove full at him with one of the queer crooked swords that the carry they came together like two  for each ran for the other  and down they tumbled at the shock but the frenchman was below our man broke his sword short off and took the other s blade through his left arm but he was the stronger man and he managed to let the life out of his enemy with the jagged stump of his blade i thought that the french would have shot him down but not a was drawn and he got back to his company with one sword through his arm and half of another in his hand chapter xiii the end of the storm of all the things that seem strange in that battle now that i look back upon it there is nothing that was than the way in which it acted on my comrades for some took it as though it had been their daily meat without question or change and others out prayers from the first to the last and again cursed and swore in a way that was to    ft  s v t          r  l     f r v r i r i r i  he er r r i r v i   j  iii l  n f    i   it ik t ir j i i  li r i ii e s i u u j or wo i n i r r i i m    ix i tt i  a  j ii  ri    i     t ii    w  i l i t li i i r t v m r r m       v  mt j  i i    i r s r u r r l l       i ki o i i r t i r t v l f u l j t      a   i v   i i  i it r  ii ij        t i u ii i t r i j i i i i            r ij ii i j v t v   v    x t i  j i       s i	edith-wharton
had hinted his suspicion you must have had as much as that if you paid eight on your books your fare to boston and your fare must be two dollars more i know that but look here bob and tom took from his pocket five half dollars and exhibited them to his companion  she gave me thirteen dollars notwithstanding this argument felt almost sure that the lost ten dollars was a part of his capital i will tell you my story now bob if you like you condemned me without a hearing as jim said when they sent him to the house of for getting drunk go ahead the substance of tom s story was that his father so hard and was such a tyrant in the house that he could endure it no longer his father and mother did not agree as any one might have suspected his mother encouraged by the success of thought that tom might do something of kind and she had provided him the money to buy hi stock of books vow ob ob had not much confidence in this story he had been deceived once besides it was not consistent with his previous narrative and he had not before hinted that he had obtained his mother s consent but tom was eloquent and protested that he had and meant to do well he declared by all that was good and great should never have reason to be ashamed of him our little merchant was troubled he could not now get rid of tom without actually quarrelling with him or running away from him he did not wish to do the former and it was not an easy matter to do the latter besides there was hope that the would do well and if he did when he carried the profits of his trade home his father would forgive him one thing was certain if he returned to he would be what he had been before for these reasons finally but very reluctantly consented that tom should remain with him however that if he did not behave himself he would leave him at once before morning he had another reason when the steamer got out into the open bay was sea the of bright sick he retired to his berth with a dreadful headache as he described it afterwards it seemed just as though that great walking beam was up and down right in the midst of his brains he had never felt so ill before in his life and was very sure in his that something worse than mere him he told tom who was not in the least affected how he felt whereupon the round got the steward and the captain into the cabin and was very sure that would die before morning if we may judge by the fuss he made the captain was angry at being called from the pilot house for nothing and threatened to throw tom overboard if he didn t stop his noise the steward however was a kind hearted man and assured that passengers were often a great deal than he was but he promised to do something for his relief and tom went with him to his state room for the desired remedy the was nothing more nor less than a table of brandy which who had conscientious scruples about drinking ardent spirits os ob at first refused to take then tom argued the point and the sick boy yielded the dose made him yet and nature came to his relief and in a little while he felt better tom behaved like a good nurse he staid by his friend till he went to sleep and then turned in upon a beneath his berth the boat pitched and tumbled about so in the heavy sea that did not sleep long and when he woke he found tom ready to assist him but our hero felt better and entreated tom to go to sleep again he made the best of his unpleasant situation sleep was not to be and he tried to pass away the dreary hours in thinking of and the dear ones there his mother was asleep arid was asleep and that was about all the excitement he could get up even on the home question he could not build castles in the air and castle building do not agree the gold and purple clouds would be black in spite of him and the structure he to build would pitch and tumble about for all the world just like a in a heavy sea as often as he got fairly into it he was violently rolled the adventures of bright out and in a twinkling found himself in his narrow berth awfully he went to sleep again at last and the long night passed away when he woke in the morning he felt tolerably well and was thankful that he had got out of that scrape but before he could dress himself he heard a terrible on deck the steam whistle was shrieking the bell was and he heard the hoarse of the captain it was certain that something had happened or was about to happen then the boat stopped rolling heavily in the sea tom was not there he had gone on deck was beginning to consider what a dreadful thing a wreck was when tom appeared what s the matter asked with some appearance of alarm fog replied tom it is so thick you can exit it with a is that all that s enough where are we that is just what the pilot would like to know now ob ok they can t see ahead a bit and don t know re we are went on deck the ocean rolled beneath them but there was nothing but fog to be seen above and around them the lead was heaved every few moments and the steamer crept slowly along till it was	isabella-lucy-bird
as these may sound easy enough yet i doubt whether even ever caught quite that note again and to me s poems on on the the solitary and the like seem more more exceptional as poetical de force than even his although i agree with those who maintain that he has left us the finest collection of which any english poet has to show i may mention the following poems as examples of the different alluded to above  which of course run into each other  simple style we are seven gray poet s pet lamb poor poems on and tables turned fragment stray pleasures poems on my heart leaps up s nest girl phantom of delight solitary transition to grand style abbey castle affliction of margaret there was a boy castle death of fox grand style happy warrior trees on immortality to duty wisdom and spirit patriotic and other evening by william i quote in illustration three of the type which in s early days was a mark for general derision   and turning from her grave i met beside the church yard a blooming girl whose hair was wet with points of morning dew a basket on her head she bare her brow was smooth and white to see a child so very fair it was a pure delight no fountain from its rocky cave e er tripped with foot so free she seemed as happy as a wave that dances on the sea  something here is something i think beyond imitation in the two april mornings from which these are taken there is of course a pathetic attitude of mind to which the lines lead up that of the father who would not if he could renew the past joy at the risk of the past sorrow others might have chosen that theme might have adorned into simplicity and into a similar recital but in what mind save s would the which close each of the three have arisen the exquisite truth of the look of the child s hair in the dew the innocent intensity of s gaze the springing of that last  fresh and vivid as of old was ocean s many twinkling smile  and the melody which with its few rustic notes the scene and it into poetry s ideal world i have said that s poems were largely concerned with the english lake country with the race and the which it was his mission both to represent and to for a bom within a few miles of s home and a few years before his death the inward picture of that country s past present future cannot rise without a touch of pain yea all that now thee  said once of how much smaller an invasion than has actually occurred i   yea all that now thee from the day on which it should be touched would melt and melt away the best remaining hope is still in it is the hope that his abiding spirit may exert an ever deeper influence upon those who look upon the land which he loved the visitors to the lake country indeed are not now mainly such as he most feared by i i william in growing proportion they are men and women who have a right to be there the right involved in real power of appreciation in real effort of voyage and journey made to reach the shrine and even now to it might perhaps have seemed that his lakes and hills might yet a new virtue wider than the old here is what we in england have of fairest of most sacred to offer let us offer it to all our kin let our great race whose tribes are mighty nations find here an and a central memory of peace there can be nothing in any passage from simplicity to greatness and we find in s poems that transition often without conscious change of tone this is especially noticeable in the  a kind of on the poet s own education where the sense of and which such a subject is constantly yielding to our sense of the s and dignity and to the interest of the of a character than which i know none of better for the future of mankind the song at the feast of castle again stands between s simple style and his grand style it rises from rustic into and from into the tranquillity of the eternal world how charged with the spirit of the mountains is the s story of the childhood of the shepherd lord  and both the fish that swim through did wait on him the pair were servants of his eye in their immortality and glancing gleaming dark or bright moved to and fro for his delight  how swiftly that passes as on one high note to bis heroic cry  in his halls on the blood of calls the the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield  at last the poet himself the strain and how sublime in its simplicity is that return and from the wild tale of war and tumult to the true victory and the peace  alas the impassioned did not know that for a tranquil soul the lay was framed by william x who long compelled in humble walks to go was softened into feeling soothed and tamed  love had he in huts where poor men lie his daily teachers had been woods and the silence that is in the sky the sleep that is among the lonely hills  but there was matter enough near home to call forth all s martial impulses and to raise his style to its last elevation a pure clear tone of heroic grandeur during the prime of the poet s powers england was engaged in her most desperate struggle with her worst and	edith-wharton
began to laugh also and the others as well but it was not a very hearty laugh either the sun was almost above us when we stopped at a little place called where there is an old pump from which drew and drank a full of water  and never did a of scotch ale taste as sweet more guns passed us here and s three of them smart men with brown horses a treat to the eye the noise of the was louder the gathering of the nations io ban ever now and it through my nerves just as had done years before when with by my side had seen the merchant ship fight with the l was so loud now that it seemed to me that the battle lust be going on just beyond the nearest wood but my the knew better it s twelve to fifteen mile off said he you may e sure the general knows we are not wanted or we not be resting here at what he said proved to be true for a minute later own came the colonel with orders that we should pile and where we were and there we stayed day while horse and foot and guns english dutch nd were streaming through the went on till evening sometimes rising into a roar sinking into a until about eight clock in the evening it stopped altogether we were our hearts out as you may think to know what all meant but we knew that what the duke did be for the best so we just waited in patience next day the remained at in the but about mid day came an orderly from the duke nd we pushed on once more until we came to a little called something and there we stopped nd time too for a sudden broke over us nd a plump of rain that turned all the roads and the into and mire we got into the at this for shelter and there we found two   ne from a regiment and the other a man of the german who had a tale to tell that was as as the weather had the the day before i the great shadow and our fellows had been sore put to it to hold their own against but had beaten him off at last it seems an old stale story to you now but you cannot think how we scrambled round those two men in the barn pushed and fought just to catch a word of what they said and how those who had heard were in turn by those who had not we laughed and cheered and groaned all in turn as we heard how the th had received cavalry in line how the dutch had fled and how the black watch had taken the into their square and then had killed them at their leisure but the had had the laugh on their side when they up the th and carried off one of the colours to it all up the duke was in retreat in order to keep in touch with the and it was that he would take up his ground and fight a big battle just at the very place where we had been halted and soon we saw that this was true for the weather cleared towards evening and we were all out on the ridge to see what we could see it was such a stretch of corn and land with the crops just half green and half yellow and fine as high as a man s shoulder a scene more full of peace you could not think of and look where you would over the low corn covered hills you could see the little village up their among the s but right across this pretty picture was a long trail of marching men  some red some green some blue some black  over the plain and choking the roads one end so close that we could shout to them as they their on the the shadow on the land io ridge at our left and the other end lost among the woods as far as we could see and then on other roads we saw the of horses toiling and the dull gleam of the guns and the men straining and swaying as they helped to turn the in tl e deep deep mud as we stood there regiment after regiment and after took position on the ridge and ere the sun had set we lay in a line of over sixty thousand men napoleon s way to but the rain had come down again and we of the st rushed off to our barn once more where we had better quarters than the greater part of our comrades who lay stretched in the mud with the storm beating upon them until the first peep of day chapter xii the shadow on the land it was still in the morning with brown drifting clouds and a damp chilly wind it was a queer thing for me as i opened my eyes to think that i should be in a battle that day though none of us ever thought it would be such a one as it proved to be we were up and ready however with the first light and as we threw open the doors of our bam we heard the most lovely music that i had ever listened to playing somewhere in the distance we all stood in clusters to it it was so sweet and innocent and sad like but our laughed when he saw how it pleased us all them are the french bands said he and if you t the great shadow come out here you ll see what some of you may not live to see again out we went the beautiful music still sounding in our ears and stood on a rise	edith-wharton

brother john of wrote a natural history of the rock and its neighborhood their fame however is by that of the author of the natural history of the scientific value of this book is not it is a of the

personal but the charm of this record not only of days but of hours in lies not in its merits as a history of the natural phenomena of an english parish but in its spirit of loving intimacy with the out of door world the book is fragrant with the wandering airs of the fields and woods each chapter is a in rural england it is a home like work because it tells of things that keen eyes might see from the cottage window or perhaps no farther than the garden dial or the graves in the ancient church yard white noted many curious things of birds and field of and and insects on his through the village lanes his humble neighbors must have caught some of his enthusiasm for natural knowledge for mention is often made of their bringing to him curious scraps oi information the results of their observations in his behalf a shepherd saw as he thought some white on a down above my house this winter were not these the the of the no doubt they were as a neighbor was lately in a dry field far removed from any water he turned out a water rat that was curiously laid up in an formed of grass and leaves at one end of the lay about a of potatoes regularly on which it was to have supported itself for the winter it was upon the birds of his district that the attention of white seems to have been chiefly he knew the times of their appearance in spring and summer so accurately that he is able to make out lists which tell the day and almost the hour of their coming he heads the list of the summer birds of passage with the which comes in the middle of march and has a harsh note with the smallest willow which appears on the d of the same month and till september some have by white  a sweet wild note some a sweet plaintive note last of all is the fly who arrives on may th and is a very mute bird he also makes a list of those birds who continue in full song until after and of those who have ceased to sing before to these he gives their latin as well as their english names his quaint shows itself in scattered latin tions bearing upon his subject sometimes in happy lines from the old english poets sometimes in a verse from the bible as when he uses the words of job in speaking of

the most figures in the restless and artificial century is this of white living his serene life near to the heart of nature writing of what he saw to sympathetic friends for himself a long and quiet

the of some cock too soon from the great woods hard by came long that passed like caresses over the roofs the meadows with their black shadows put on a mysterious and secluded majesty while all the running waters that forth into the darkness by mile seemed to be the cool and breathing of the sleeping country at moments the mill wheel fast asleep seemed to be dreaming like those old watch dogs

inhabitants still more they would surely fall upon the village at night and cut everybody s throat the night before a little before daybreak there had been an alarm the inhabitants had up hearing a great noise of men on the road the women were just falling on their knees and crossing themselves when red trousers were recognized through cracks of windows opened it was a of french the captain immediately asked for the mayor of the place and stayed at the mill after talking with old the sun rose that day it would be hot at noon over the woods floated a yellow light while in the distance above the meadows rose white the clean pretty village awoke in the cool air and the country with its river and springs had the dew sprinkled loveliness of a but this fine weather made no one laugh they had just seen the captain walk round about the mill examine the neighboring houses cross to the other side of the and from there study the country through a old who was with him seemed to be explaining the country to him then the captain stationed soldiers behind walls behind trees in holes in the ground the bulk of the was stationed in the court yard of the by mill so there was to be a fight and when old came back he was plied with questions he gave a long nod with his head without speaking yes there was to be a fight and were in the court yard looking at him at last he took his pipe out of his mouth and said simply  ah my poor children there will be no wedding for you tomorrow his lips set a line of anger across his forehead raised himself up on from time to time with his eyes fixed on the woods as if he longed to see the come very pale serious came and went supplying the soldiers with what they needed they were making their soup in a comer of the court yard and joking while waiting for their meal meanwhile the captain seemed delighted he had examined the rooms and the great hall of the mill looking out upon the river now sitting by the well he was talking with old you have a real fortress here said he we ought to hold out till evening the beggars are late they should be here by this time the miller looked serious he saw his mill flaming like a torch but he did not complain thinking it useless he only opened his mouth to say  you ought to have some one hide the boat behind the wheel there is a hole there that will hold her perhaps she may be of use the

sewing in most style in one of these boats but if you hail it she is the heavy oar in one moment and as likely as not with a wise looking baby on her back supported by a square piece of scarlet cloth embroidered in gold and blue not one of this river population has yet received christianity very little indeed is known about them and their customs but it is said that their morals are low and that when was less discouraged than it is now the river was the convenient grave of many of their female children i spent most of one afternoon alone in one of these boats into all and water streets hanging on to and passage boats and enjoying the variety of river life to the full on another day i was carried eighteen miles through on a chair by four mr smith and his brother walking the whole distance a great testimony to the influences of the winter climate as to one must either walk or be carried a human being is not a heavy weight for the but it is distressing to see that the shoulders of very many of them are suffering from bony arising from the pressure of the poles we in the open air upon a stone table under a tree at the five which forms the north east comer of the great wall of from which we looked down upon the singular of the nearly forgotten conquest the walled inner city of the containing the garrison the residence of the governor the houses of the foreign and the population the streets of this foreign of are narrow and dirty with mean low houses with roofs nearly flat and small more like the houses of western than eastern asia letter iv light and colour these do not differ much in from the chinese they are somewhat their stature is shorter and the women always wear three rings in their ears i saw more women in a street in one day in the city than i have seen altogether in the rest of the view from that corner of the wall to my thinking is beautiful the flaming red with its many roofs the picturesque ancient gray wall all and downs watch towers and the city below with the the the bright foliage of the and the grace of the outside the wall the white cloud hills and nearer for the dead their red and pink and orange hues by a thin blue veil softening without all lying in the glory of the winter noon  light without heat colour without glare vanish all memories of and pale before this this wealth of and colour colour is at once music and vitality and after long i in it this wall is a fine old structure about twenty feet wide and as many high with a broad pavement on which to walk and a high platform on the outside with a pierced for it is hardly ever level for ten yards but follows the of the ground and has picturesque towers which occur frequently it is everywhere draped with which do not help to it in repair the five which flames in red at one of its angles is a striking feature in the view as we sat on stone seats by stone tables in what might be called its shadow under the heaven with the pure of the city spread out at our feet  that which takes one captive at once and like the first sight of a palm or  the golden iv a a longing of which one had not previously been conscious  a disappointment was severely felt we had been as the americans say for five hours in the air and i had long been conscious of a craving for solid food which no could satisfy and our dismay was great not only to find that the cook had put up lunch for two when there were three hungry persons but that the chicken was so that we could not eat it and as we were not starving enough to go and feed at a cat and dog or any other chinese my hosts at least who have not learned that are for men as well as food for gods were as we ate pie or dined with duke two water dark gray forms with little more hair than horns and like deer watched us closely until a drove them oflf such beasts which stand in the water and plaster themselves with mud like are the cows and draught oxen of china two nice chinese boys sat by us and mr smith practised chinese upon them tiu a man came out angrily and took them away using many words of which we only understood devils the are not rude however a foreign lady can walk alone without being actually though as a rule chinese women are not seen in the streets i have certainly seen half a million men and not more than ninety women and those only of the poorest class the middle and upper class women never go out except in closed with windows and are nearly as much secluded as the women of india passing through the city and some streets of aristocratic inhabited by wealthy merchants we spent some hours in the quarter which is practically one vast market or thronged with iv street sights and sounds masculine humanity from morning night eight feet is the width of the street but one and between the by the the people standing at eating or drinking tea and the of goods it is one long push then as you are your feeble self among the big men who are made truly monstrous by their many garments of silk and you are terrified by a loud yell and being out of the way you become aware that the crowd has yielded place to a procession	walt-whitman
bear i sincerely beg your pardon after a slight pause continued you will at least let me say that your conduct excited my admiration on the way to the i sought any excuse to be near you you went with mr into a place of danger and for a few moments i feared you had perished all i hastened after you determined either to save or die at your side my strength gave way and again i felt your arms around me your presence the one barrier between me and death i was more than ever determined that if possible i would teach you to love me as i loved you a sugar princess the soft of the young woman s voice came to s ears like music she seemed to him a beautiful serpent that before it strikes he would have tried once more to silence her but his clung to the roof of his mouth then came the trip to mr engaged you by my request yes that is the simple truth papa had already i think guessed my secret and approved my choice mamma wanted me to marry some gentleman of rank but i had no idea of doing anything of the kind there have been times when i thought you cared for me arid would yet me so again you have seemed to avoid even to dislike me i planned this trip we are now taking to settle the question definitely i have settled it her voice had sunk so low that it was scarcely audible the young man waited for what he felt sure would follow a peal of laughter at the part she was playing if she wanted to think she had him into believing anything she said that she might make his discomfiture complete by turning him to ridicule it would be quite as well the woman he had loved was a this heartless creature had her place he would bear his pain all the better knowing that his ideal had never existed but the peal of laughter did not come instead a complete silence followed presently he became aware that miss van s horse was not following his and glancing uneasily back he saw that had stopped in the path and was apparently waiting for the others feeling that in his capacity of guide he ought a sugar princess not to leave her alone even for a few minutes he turned and walked his horse slowly toward her suddenly a scream of terror came from the girl s lips and at the same instant saw what had caused it a serpent quite eight feet in length was making its way slowly across the path in front of her now the of are not as a rule dangerous to the human species no doubt this one was quite as badly frightened as when she gave utterance to that piercing shriek saw however that her fright might have one serious consequence she was in her saddle and her stupid was making no move to save her from the fall that seemed imminent springing to the ground ran to her side whereupon she fell into his arms in the most approved fashion and for a moment quite lost consciousness neither of the others who belonged to the party was near enough to hear the scream or see the commotion the looked on as there was no water at hand the road being too high up on the mountains laid his burden gently on the and began to slap her hands briskly as the means of restoring her circulation presently she moved slightly and her eyes opened then the recollection of what had caused her terror returned and she grasped her protector s arm don t let it touch me she cried faintly don t let it touch me it has gone there is nothing to fear he responded coldly are you able to sit up a sugar princess she looked about her and saw for the first time that she was not in the saddle what a horrible thing it was she said closing her eyes at the recollection did i fall from the horse i don t feel bruised the figures of the remaining members of party appeared in the distance and was about to call to them when she raised an objection i don t think we had better tell them about the snake she said it might frighten and it can do no good i was awfully silly to be alarmed but really it was a dreadful looking thing i know she went on with a little sob you are very angry with me but you might help me to rise when i am so weak he assisted her to her feet and she leaned her weight upon him till the others were near when started to bade her remain where she was she said she had had a slight attack of but was all right now there happened to be a tea house a short distance away and the new went on to it to order some light refreshment prepared after a few minutes lifted into her saddle and then walked by her side holding her on are you never going to forgive me she murmured if you won t say such things again i will try he answered gloomily but i must say them again she said putting her a sugar princess rt hand on his arm i must say them again and again and again for they are true her voice sunk as low as a and her sweet breath his cheek i love you i love you i love you a sugar princess chapter a there was something in the of the voice that stirred the young man s soul he turned toward the speaker as if in a dream and involuntarily held out his hand she clasped it with a movement that spoke more than words before	arthur-conan-doyle

cut short by his being appointed to a prominent european power here his temper had full swing and he everybody for three years at the end of that time he nearly caused a war and was recalled there was some talk of his being appointed for india but those in power had sufficient pity on the country not to send him in india would have been on his native heath for failing from his reputation to get another appointment took to with his sons the elder had a of the paternal temper and refused to submit consequently he was forbidden the house and crowned his in the old man s eyes by marrying this was a severe blow to who had the pride as well as the temper of he refused to hold any communication with and thus the son remained abroad on an income inherited from his mother until he was murdered at san as his income ceased on his death for it to his mother s relatives george the boy was left dependent on the charity of his two denied the marriage and refused to acknowledge the infant took the child to his home and brought him up then the lad disappeared when died and reappeared under the name of had discovered his s identity in the way described by the younger was a fool meek as moses and completely by his terrible father he married an equally meek lady and the two were crushed by the old tyrant finally both died as gladly as the late lady had done and left walter to carry on the title the old lord detested walter a fireside tyrant as a but he refused to acknowledge george preferring the fool to the clever man from sheer hatred of s father house in st square was an immense mansion which cost no end of money to keep up and as its lord was not over rich he would have done better to remove to a more modest residence but s pride would not permit him to his living and he dwelt alone in the big house when walter s parents were alive they had occupied a corner so that could bully them at his leisure and now walter himself remained as a boy but he was cunning enough to keep out of his grandfather s way and contrived to be more independent than his parents had been perhaps was too old to carry on an active war but he certainly gave walter more license than he had ever accorded to any human being a good deal of contempt for the weak little had to do with this permitting him to act as he pleased there is no excitement in a sheep the meeting with george at mrs ward s had touched the old man nearly he had never set eyes on s son before and had no idea that the young fellow was so handsome and clever felt that he could take some pride in george as a man who would not permit himself to be he had as strong a will as his grandfather and the older man respected him moreover george s refusal to accept an income when he took a feigned name and his determined fight for his pleased the but for his pride and hatred of the father might have acknowledged the marriage he knew in his own mind that such a marriage had taken place and that george was legitimate but he did not know where the ceremony the yellow had been celebrated the sole evidence he possessed was a letter written by from paris stating that he had married at the time accepted the fact and had never thought of inquiring about details from his son and of course when died it was too late mrs knew and mrs had made use of her knowledge but she never told anything had she done so her hold over him might have feeble although owing to her knowledge and to the old man s determination not to acknowledge george it could not be done away with altogether the library in house was a vast and splendid

great houses at race meetings at and sometimes in the house his movements were carefully in the morning post and he took care to let his friends know that he was still alive for the rest he sat in his

one worth knowing for the last half century and had as bitter a pen as he had a tongue also he knew many secrets of so it may be guessed that many great families did not look forward to the

watching all along for the right time to order the assault at last about nine o clock she cried out now  to the assault r and the blew the charge instantly we saw the body of men that had been appointed to this service move forward toward a point where the concentrated fire of our guns had the upper half of a broad stretch of wall to ruins we saw this force descend into the ditch and begin to plant the we were soon with them the lieutenant general thought the assault e but said ah gentle duke are you afraid do you not know that i have promised to send you home safe it was warm work in the the walls were crowded with men and they of stones down upon us there was one gigantic englishman who did us more hurt than any dozen of his brethren he always the places easiest of assault and

so stubborn that people began to show signs of mark twain doubt and dismay seeing this raised her inspiring battle cry and descended into the herself the dwarf helping her and the sticking bravely at

over the like the garrison fled we was ours the earl of was hemmed in and surrounded and the duke d and the of demanded that he surrender himself but he was a proud nobleman and came of a proud race he refused to his sword to saying i will die rather i will surrender to the maid of alone and to no other and so he did and was courteously and used by her his two brothers retreated fighting step by step toward the bridge we pressing their despairing forces and cutting them down by scores arrived on the bridge the slaughter still continued alexander de la pole was pushed overboard or fell over and was drowned eleven hundred men had fallen john de la pole decided to give up the struggle recollections of of arc but he was nearly as proud and particular as his brother of as to whom he would surrender to the french officer nearest at hand was who was pressing him closely sir john said to him are you a gentleman yes and a knight no then sir john him himself there on the bridge giving him

surrender ah yes a proud tribe those de la poles it was a grand day a memorable day a most splendid victory we had a crowd of prisoners but would not allow them to be hurt we took them with us and

this mean asked in a more subdued tone where is a prisoner in fort we came out after this vessel and we have her you expected her then we did some one has betrayed me groaned the traitor no sir you betrayed yourself when those living fires of which you spoke begin to glow you will not be there replied by the f a naval officer r chapter xvi mb comes to he was a steamer of about eight hundred tons her capture was complete and it only remained to make the proper dispositions for sending her into port which of course could only be done by the captain mr you will proceed to the with your prisoner and report to the captain the capture of the steamer said mr when he had placed his little force in positions where they could any attempt to the vessel touched his cap and requested his prisoner to go over the side into the boat was silent and sullen he had been robbed of his last hope  nd the glowing fabric he had painted of the great southern suddenly into ruins for most men identify their own fate with that of their nation he went below with the ship s and pointed out his personal effects which were put into the boat without a remark he went down the accommodation ladder and seated himself

waiting further orders they shall be sent to him presently mr was detailed as prize master with mr as first and mr as second officers but before you go mr there is a matter of some importance to be adjusted pass the word for mr said the captain mr may i trouble you to go below i am your prisoner and you can do with me as you please growled the captain went down into his cabin followed by the

examining her papers i think i understand perfectly what i am about captain my ship is a british steamer bound from one british port to another are you a british subject demanded the captain i do not

been ordered to appear he looked very much astonished at the invitation he had received and it was clear that he did not know whether to expect a shock or an appointment on board of the prize took no notice of him as he entered and perhaps this fact had some influence in the young gentleman s future course mr said the captain with a queer smile which the senior of the could not we have a friend of

paradise  grand large free flowing unconscious and incapable of formality bacon precise and reserved in expression shakespeare a player and with words often swept away by his own verbal into intellectual and almost into moral bacon without humor shakespeare s smiling lips the of humor for all human kind bacon looking at the world before him and at the teaching of past ages with a single eye to his theories and his individual purposes shakespeare finding in the wisdom and the folly the woes and the pleasures of the past and the present merely the means of giving pleasure to others and getting money for himself and rising to his height as a poet and a moral teacher only by his sensitive intellectual sympathy with all the needs and joys and sorrows of humanity bacon shrinking from a even in morals shakespeare ever and dealing even with individual men and particular things in their general relations both worldly wise both men of the world  for both these master of the christian era were worldly minded men in the thorough sense of the term  but the one using his knowledge of men and things in philosophy and in affairs the other his as a artist bacon a highly trained mind and showing his training at every step of his cautious steady march shakespeare wholly and showing his want of training even in the highest reach of his soaring flight bacon utterly without the poetic even in a secondary degree as is most apparent when he desires to show the contrary shakespeare rising with unconscious by richard grant white to the highest heaven of poetry ever reached by the human mind to suppose that one of these men did his own work and also the work of the other is to assume two miracles for the sake of proving one absurdity and to shrink from accepting in the son of the a miraculous miracle  one that does not defy or the laws of nature many readers of these pages probably know that this notion that our shakespeare  the shakespeare of as you like it and hamlet and king  was francis bacon in the guise of a player at the globe theatre is not of very recent origin it was first brought before the public by miss bacon who afterwards her theory in a ponderous volume with an introduction by  who did not advocate it in an article in s magazine for january some time before that article was published and shortly after the publication of shakespeare s scholar it was sent to me in proof by the late mr george p with a letter calling my attention to its importance and a request that i would write an introduction to it after reading it carefully and without prejudice for i knew nothing of the theory or of its author and as i have already said i am perfectly indifferent as to the name and the personality of the writer of the plays and had as it should have been francis bacon as william shakespeare i returned the article to mr declining the proposed honor of introducing it to the public and adding that as the writer was plainly neither a fool nor an she must be insane not a but what boys call so it proved she died a lunatic and i believe in a lunatic asylum i record this incident for the first time on this occasion not at all in the spirit of i told you so but merely as a fitting preliminary to the declaration that this bacon shakespeare notion is an  a literary bee in the of certain ladies of both sexes which should make them the objects of tender care and sympathy it will not be extinguished at once on the contrary it may become a mental for there is no notion no fancy or folly which may not be developed into a movement or even into a school by and agitation i do not despair of seeing a bacon shakespeare society with an array of vice of both sexes that may make the new shakespeare society look to its none the less however is it a which should be treated with all the skill and tenderness by richard grant white which modem medical science and humanity have developed proper should be provided and kept ready with horses and when symptoms of the bacon shakespeare manifest themselves the patient should be immediately carried to the asylum furnished with pens ink and paper a copy of bacon s works one of the shakespeare plays and one of mrs s and that good lady is largely responsible for the development of this harmless mental disease and other called and the literary results which would be copious should be received for publication with respect and then  committed to the flames in this way the innocent victims of the malady might be soothed and and the world protected against the influence of of tedious as to treating the question seriously that is not to be done by men of common sense and moderate knowledge of the subject even the present not very serious or i fear sufficiently considerate examination of it to which i was not very ready but much the contrary me to say almost with henry s words that i could divide myself and go to for being moved by such a dish of milk to so honorable an action it is as certain that william shakespeare wrote after the theatrical fashion and under the theatrical conditions of his day the plays which bear his name as it is that francis bacon wrote the the advancement of learning and the essays we know this as well as we know any fact in history the notion that bacon also wrote the comedy of errors hamlet king and is not worth five minutes serious consideration by any reasonable

more mrs ward became quite exasperated and her efforts to of the creature as she called she took to him on all occasions and sometimes asked him to dinner at the same time she constantly abused young walter who was lord s and heir he was the man she wished to marry as one day a lovers meeting he would have a title and fifteen thousand a year but m spite of this policy still continued to love george and expressed a hearty dislike for walter whom she as a if he had only the of his grandfather i might respect him mrs ward turned pale under her when she heard this oh no no lord is a terrible old man were walter such as he is i should not ask you to marry him you would marry me to the prince of darkness himself if it suited your purpose said her daughter calmly from which speech it will be seen that miss ward had small respect for her fascinating mother the two did not as their dispositions were so different mrs ward complained that was too religious and found the frivolous world in which her mother moved dull beyond words it so happened that stayed mostly at home or went out with one of her who was something of her type while mrs ward enjoyed herself at and the little always managed to keep on the right side as she had no notion of losing her position in society or the income which lord allowed her but within she was extremely fast she generally had a number of young men at her heels and made use of them in and in getting boxes for the for at the and gloves when nothing else was to be had but she managed all these things so that no one had a word to say and the general impression was that she was a dear little woman with a stiff daughter  quite a trial and if some old did praise up and condemn the mother they were in the the yellow things were in this position when the murder of mrs took place read about it in the papers and knowing that george had gone to stop in the house with train was extremely anxious to hear particulars she wrote to his address asking him to call but received no reply then she saw that he gave evidence at the and two days later george made his appearance at the street house mrs ward who had been in her expressions regarding s love for low company so she put it sailed toward him with open hands she always welcomed in this bright girlish way as it was part of her scheme she thought so serious a man would never relish a frivolous mother in law and hoped to get rid of him in this way but was too much in love with to mind the of her fashionable parent my dear mr cried mrs ward in her usual manner i am so glad to see you the murder you know i saw your name in the papers how exciting how tell us all about it there is nothing to tell mrs ward said george glancing round the room and seeing that was absent all i know is set forth in the papers mrs ward arranged herself on the sofa and laughed quite exciting it is she said i wonder who killed the poor woman and how did you come to be there on the very night she died this last question was asked sharply and with a keen glance george was rather taken but not thinking she had any intention in what she said answered enough i went to see a friend mrs ward it was unfortunate that i chose that night well of course you didn t know said mrs a lovers meeting ward but fancy knowing any one living in an out of the way place like that but you do know such queer people george thought he knew none than mrs ward herself but he suppressed this speech as my friend is mr train really i think i have met him his father made a fortune out of or or something horrid what was he doing there looking for characters for a book oh mrs ward opened her eyes did he find any i believe so but he has left the house now i should think every one would leave it after the murder said mrs ward will be down soon but meantime tell me the whole thing from your own clever point of view she was so that had to yield he detailed events as they had been reported by the press but concerning the confidence of he kept silent mrs ward expressed her disappointment when he finished you tell me nothing new i warned you that i would not replied wondering at her speech but surely you can throw some light on the matter said ward shook his head i fear not i went to bed at eleven and slept soundly until i was awakened by the mrs ward thought for a moment does mr train know anything nothing more than i have told you declared he disliked from the truth even in the smallest particular but he dare not risk the story of his birth becoming public property it was strange he thought that the yellow mrs ward should take such a profound interest in this ease he had never before heard her talk on such a subject to add to his perplexity he saw that in spite of her in spite of the shaded windows she looked haggard yet it was impossible that she could be connected with the matter in any way he ventured a leading question why are you so anxious to know about this case mrs

has a strong resemblance to the wild of the the mountains rise from the river to a height of over feet ghastly snow look over them their slopes always steep often break up into cliffs or feet high the river has often not a yard of margin and along crashing and a thing of power and fury which has never been tamed of mankind its sea green colouring a thing of beauty and its and stretches of foam

abundance all dwarf with the to sin in blossom covered the stony broken three species of warm scented and brown of of were in the of the rocks and the rocks themselves were often tinged rose pink with the early leaves and delicate clasping fingers of s it was a clear escape from the crowds of china the traffic on the road was mostly there is little room for crops an occasional patch among the rocks near the river and small fields then growing and later starved great heights where the mountain slope is less steep than usual small as the population is it does not grow enough for its wants so many of the men hunt the deer and wild on the mountains and sell the in in the winter and others trap the fur bearing animals which appear to be an inferior and there are a few on the road which chiefly by supplying the needs of travellers but the was usually hidden away and made no display on the street rice is scarce and not always and wherever we halted instead of the of ready cooked which tempt rope bridges the appetite there was rarely even a fire and it was always an hour before anything was cooked the though much better than any i had been accustomed to and often built of new boards do not provide any fire in the mornings unless by special arrangement and till this was understood i started without tea their stock of food was soon exhausted even at the larger villages where we halted for the night and the descent upon them of twelve hungry persons was unwelcome some of the are built at great heights and are accessible by rugged paths and steps cut in the rock the people are hardy rough and fairly friendly the chinese are to my thinking men of plains and rivers and paths  a rice eating people with the water here they are abruptly into hardy hunters and fed even the women though still binding the feet are independent in their air and movements and perform in crossing rivers the country is a cross between china and however there are no temples and few or other signs of religion fully one third of the population is on the west side of the cut off from the high road with its business and by a furious torrent and in most cases too poor to bridges their strong nerves

as far as from which point i saw no more of them the stretch a cable at a great height across the it as well as they can and secure each end round a round stone or a convenient rock sometimes a shed

as he came out of the mr made no parade of what he had done he never subjected any student to unnecessary humiliation he indulged in no reproaches and preached no sermons he went on deck intending to leave the to the influence of the better thoughts which he hoped and believed had been kindled in his mind by the events of the day mr remained a moment to give a final outward bound or tion to the penitent as he regarded him and then went to his cabin are you going to turn in asked not yet are there any of our fellows below plenty of them our fellows was a term applied to that portion of the

bad boys by the discipline of the ship they were kept in good order and compelled to perform their duties as in every community of men or boys where persons of kindred tastes find each other out the bad boys in the young america had discovered those of like tendencies and a bond of sympathy and tion had been established among them they knew and were known of each other on the other hand it is equally true that there was a bond of sympathy and association among the good boys as there is among good men if a good man wishes to establish a daily prayer meeting he does not apply to tlie the profane and the of his neighborhood for help there is a among men which leads him to the right persons if a bad man to get up a mob a or a he does not seek assistance among those who go to church

fourth positively bad while the remaining two are more or less good or more or less bad floating between the two poles of the moral sometimes drawn one way and sometimes the other the young america was a world in herself and the moral composition of her people was similar to that of on a larger scale she had all the elements of good and evil on board one fourth of the students were doubtless high minded moral young men having fixed principles and being willing to make great sacrifices rather than do as good behavior as well as in the studies was an element of success in the ship a large proportion of the positively good boys were in the after cabin another fourth of the students were reckless and with no respect for authority except so far as it was purchased by fear of punishment or hope of reward occasionally one of tliis class worked his way into the cabin by superior natural ability and a attempt to better his condition on board the rest of the ship s company belonged to the indefinite class floating more or less distant from the positive elements of good or evil they were not bad boys for with proper influences they could be and were kept from evil ways they were not good boys on principle for they could be led away in paths of error our fellows were the positively bad boys of the floating academy and they existed in no greater outward bound or portion in the ship s company than in the of the great world to this class belonged and others to the positively good boys belonged and others  not all of them in the after cabin by any means and walked forward to find

masters ever painted angels in thread if not it was a great dear old lady she has had enough sorrow in her life to any common mortal her husband her two sons and her near kin are all dead before her but she is too sweet and fine to when sorrow does not sour how it and old lady was greatly interested about baby and we of her in a delightful way for half an hour it pleases me very much she said at last to see how you are i never had any doubt about you at all except that i wondered you july could really mother a baby i knew you would love it and be kind of course but babies ought to have if they are really to i flushed with pleasure and asked if she meant that she had thought me cut out for an old maid if i did she answered with that smile of hers which always makes me want to kiss her on the spot i shall never think so again you ve the genuine mother instinct she looked at me a moment as if questioning with herself the truth is she went on as if she had made up her mind to say the whole you have been for years making an intellectual interest do instead of real love and of course your manner showed it i could not ask her what she meant though i only half understood and i wished to hear more she grew suddenly more serious and spoke in a lower tone she asked i am an old woman and i am fond of you may i say something that may sound impertinent of course i told her she might say anything and that i knew she could not be impertinent i could not think what was coming she leaned forward and put her thin hand on mine the little hand with its old fashioned rings it is just this be careful whom you marry i m so afraid you marry somebody out of charity at least don t think of being a parson s wife a parson s wife i echoed not in the least seeing what she meant that would be worse than to take up with the a the of a saint prodigal son she added not my though it does seem to me my dear that you are too good to be just served up like a calf in honor of his return i stared at her with bewilderment so complete that she burst into a soft laugh as mellow as her old i am speaking of course and it s no matter now about the prodigal i only wanted to suggest that you are not just the wife for mr and  mr i i burst out interrupting her i think for the first time in my life why who ever thought of anything so preposterous oh you innocent i she laughed i knew you d be the last one to see it and i wanted to warn you so that he need not take you entirely by surprise he is my and a very good man in his way but he is n t our kind my dear i sat staring at her in a sort of while i suddenly remembered how much mr has been to see me lately and how self conscious he has seemed sometimes i had not a word to say even in protest and old lady having i suppose accomplished all she wished in warning me dropped the subject entirely and turned back to s doings and welfare the idea that mr has been thinking of me as a possible is certainly ludicrous i believe thoroughly any girl should thank heaven for a good man s love but in this case i do not see how love comes into the question at all i cannot help feeling that he would be the sort of a husband to put into a pot there to bid him drum and at least he will lose no sleep from a july passion for me certainly i should be starved if i had to live with him he is not naturally a man of much power of thinking i suppose and he has never cultivated the habit one cannot help seeing that whatever his original they have been spoiled by his profession a minister father said to me once must either be so spiritual that his creed has no power to restrain him or a poor crippled thing pathetic because the desire of rising has made him himself with vows i think i understand what he meant and i am afraid mr is of the latter sort a man who meant well and so pledged himself always to cling to the belief the church had made for him no matter what higher light might come into his life he is to be pitied  though he would not understand why he could hardly care for anybody so far from his way of thinking as i am so old lady cannot be right there july george is having his house enlarged mrs is certainly energetic with what is perhaps a western energy she has been married only about four months george told me the other day that he meant to make the house larger wants a bigger parlor he explained rather ill at ease i thought the house is big enough for me but when a man has a wife things are different there was a labored in his manner which troubled me he has bought a and pony for her i hope that he is not going beyond his means as for a larger parlor i am afraid that mrs will have to fill it with rather odd people the of a saint july has shown a new side to her which troubles me it is all i suppose part of her	charles-dickens

one of the enthusiastic students and they were given with unusual zeal the principal attempted to with his guest declaring that he intended to take the students to paris and but mr insisted that he should never forgive himself if he did not do all he the crew of the had saved the lives of his family and he was anxious to testify his gratitude though he could never discharge the obligation possibly he was not familiar enough with the plans of the principal to understand and appreciate them and desired to entertain the students on a scale during the than he supposed the resources or the discipline of the academy would permit mr was of course very anxious and troubled about the but having done all he could to them he was not disposed to the opportunities for instruction and amusement which were presented to the faithful ones there would be no loss of time so far as the studies were concerned young america in france and as the morning brought no tidings of the it was evident that she had not struck upon any of the rocks or near the mouth of the the were all good whatever else they were and as they were abundantly supplied with all the for the vessel in safety there was really but little danger that they would wreck the mr and the vice principal had reasoned that ship s duty would soon disgust the and they would make a port to enjoy themselves in a manner more to their taste keeping watch taking in and setting sail were an old story to them and they would seek enjoyment of a different kind on shore mr had consulted with the custom house officers at and taken such measures as would cause the arrest of the and the of the vessel when she made a french port mr therefore expected to hear from them at or within two or three days the principal who as a naval officer had for months after a suspected vessel knew how uncertain were the chances of either of the two finding the but he hoped she would be found and brought back he felt sure the would not attempt to cross the ocean for the vessel was not watered or for a long voyage mr was energetic and skilful and the chances of the making a long were very small the vice principal was directed when the was recovered to keep her present crew close prisoners on board and compel o palace and cottage or them to work up their studies in which most of them were deficient while their visited paris and having disposed of this unpleasant business as satisfactorily as the circumstances would admit the principal gave his whole attention to the proposed excursion assured that in a few days the wild of the would end in grief and sadness to them at half past ten a small steamer conveyed the students of the ship to the shore each of them was dressed in his best clothes and carried his jacket and little bag they marched to the railroad station w here they took their seats in the carriages which are constructed similar to those used on english some of them have seats upon the top with a covering to protect the passengers from the sun and the rain thus forming a kind of two story car the occupied a in one of the first class carriages in which paul and dr were invited to take seats this arrangement was a very pleasant one to tlie young captain f and seated opposite his fair companion at the window of the he was not likely to devote his usual attention to the scenery on the way i am so sorry mr is not here said grace as the train started i am so grateful to him and i had promised myself a t deal of pleasure in his society during this trip it is very unfortunate for him replied paul i never was so amazed in my life as when father came to the hotel and told us that some of the students had run away with the  the d ar little ship i love her almost as well as my own young america in france and home added she warmly but i thought all your students were such good boys that they never did anything wrong i mean with only two or three exceptions like mr i am sorry they are not all as good as you supposed almost all of them are good hearted fellows but a little wild answered paul generously they are full of spirit and fond of adventure i sometimes wish mr would take the to africa or asia and let us hunt lions and and go among tlie natives certainly he will never do that probably not at least not until we have spent a year or more in the waters of europe but i think we shall go to to and egypt if you do you must tell me all about them in your letters i may not be with the ship so long i expect to in the fall but will write you all about the and i think he would be very glad to do so added paul i dare say he can write much better letters than i can i don t think they could be any better captain do you think mr is concerned in that wicked trip i do not think so answered paul very promptly why didn t they put him in the boat with then inquired grace i don t know but it is certain that they locked him into a state room and that proves he was not one of the party i think he to induce them to come back if he can h io palace and cottage or o i hope so it would break my heart to	isabella-lucy-bird
one of the first of obligations the support of his parents in their old age the of opinion among and non as to the crime of smoking and its results leads me to believe that it brings about the and

packing heavy rain or a strong west wind during this process is very injurious the y iv tobacco and cotton have been previously planted and make a good appearance as soon as the have been cleared away eight years ago it was rather exceptional for women and children to smoke but the chinese estimate that in and other producing regions from forty to sixty per cent are now where is not grown the habit is chiefly confined to the cities but it is rapidly spreading its existence is obvious among the lower classes from the exceeding poverty which it millions of the working classes earn barely enough to provide them with what even to their limited notions are the necessaries of life and the money spent on is withdrawn from these hence the confirmed among the poor is apt to look half starved and ragged still i am bound to say that i did not encounter any of those awful specimens of physical that i saw some years ago in the states from the same cause among the well to do and well nourished classes the evils of are doubtless more moral than physical among the masses both evils are combined the lower orders of officials and with their unlimited leisure are generally among my official in

severe depression after the of the pipe has passed off great suffering and total whether voluntary or enforced produces an anguish which the will of the is powerless to contend with the craving grows

to consider himself a victim of the habit those who place themselves in with the hope of cure endure agonies which they describe to be as if wolves were at their and would if permitted tear off their skin to relieve the severe internal suffering on my journey we were on a desolate and had to spend the night in the entrance to a coal pit cold wet and badly fed my had relied on being able to buy and

he had destroyed the beggar s sole means of it was then his duty to him by taking him into his service the of benevolence in conclusion the chinese teach benevolence charity is required as a proof of sincere goodness the religious writings relief of sick persons and compassion to the poor and the worship of the goddess of mercy an popular in china in the same humane direction it must be remembered also that the worshipped in china are not monsters of cruelty and of evil but on the contrary that they may be with some of the virtues and among them that of benevolence o chapter xviii from wan to san finding that it was impossible for any european to accompany me i decided to venture on the journey of miles to fu alone and to buy my own experience the land journey developed into one of about miles and was accomplished with one serious and one great disappointment it was interesting throughout and taught me much of the ways of the people and the scenery alone would have repaid me for the hardships which were many my greatest difficulty consisted in having to all information about the route and the and customs of the people through the medium of two languages out of the of persons who neither observed nor thought accurately nor were accustomed to impart what they knew who were used to telling lies and to whom i could furnish no reasons for telling the truth while they might have several for deceiving me on some points this digging into and cunning is the hardest part of a traveller s day so far as i could make out before or since my journey no british traveller or missionary has published an account of the country between wan on the and north of the plain nor can i find among the very valuable reports to which i cannot too often express my debt one which has done for this region of central what mr of the service at has lately done so admirably for northern consequently on the greater part of my four months journey i had nothing by which to estimate the value of the facts which i supposed myself to have obtained i must also mention in of sundry faults of which i am conscious that i went to western china solely for interest and pleasure and not with any intention of writing a book and that instead of having careful and copious notes i have only journal letters to rely upon preparations for travelling the longer one travels the fewer preparations one makes and the smaller is one s i got nothing at wan except a large sheet doubly with boiled oil and some additional kindly furnished by my kind hosts from boxes of and invalid comforts which had just arrived and the like of which were delivered carriage free at the door of every china inland missionary however remote sent by the late mr of a thoughtful gift of great value to the the reader may be amused to learn the singular monotony of my diet i had a cup of tea made from and a plate of boiled flour every morning before starting tea on arriving and for days at seven fowl or eggs with rice i got another chinese cotton costume and some straw shoes and for any other needs trusted to supplying them on the way my servant had made himself persistently disagreeable from the beginning and though a superior fairly educated and handsome man he seemed helpless useless lazy unwilling and objectionable all round the impression of my hosts and myself was that he wished to annoy me into sending him back from wan and mr thought that he would make my journey very difficult and unpleasant but the choice lay between giving it up on the threshold and taking him and i chose the latter as the guest of a european all the difficulties of arranging and paying are lifted off one and put upon a teacher or servant who is used to them and after much a bargain was concluded by which three chair and four were to take me and my baggage to fu in nineteen days a halt on sundays being paid for at the rate of cash these men were not dealt with directly but were engaged by contract with the manager of a transport who is responsible for their good conduct and honesty i may say at once that they behaved admirably made the journey in two days less than the time cheerfully through rain and mud never their work and were always sober cheery and obliging i never met with other than the same behaviour on all the occasions when my or were engaged from a my light comfortable chair had a well under the

wish to say that if miss van desired it i will assume charge of her until her father comes i am somewhat older than you and in the circumstances thanked the speaker warmly saying he had removed a

said that is very singular very singular i sat still and let the cold sweat nm down i was in a good deal of trouble but i believed i could worry through if she wouldn t ask me to men and things ii name any more children i wondered where the lightning was going to strike next she was still over that last child s title but presently she said i have always been sorry you were away at the time  i would have had you name my child your child are you married i have been married thirteen years you mean no married the youth by your side is my son it seems incredible  even impossible i do not mean any harm by it but would you mind telling me if you are any over eighteen  that is to say will you tell me how old you are i was just nineteen the day of the storm we were talking about that was my birthday that did not help matters much as i did not know the date of the storm i tried to think of some non thing to say to keep up my end of the talk and render my poverty in the matter of reminiscences as little noticeable as possible but i seemed to be about out of things i was about to say you haven t changed a bit since then  but that was i thought of saying you have improved ever so much since then  but that wouldn t answer of course i was about to try a shy at the weather for a saving change when the girl slipped in ahead of me and said best funny stories how i have enjoyed this talk over those hap old times  haven t you i never have spent such a half hour in all my life before said i with emotion and i could have added with a near approach to truth and i would rather be than spend another one like it i was grateful to be through with the ordeal and was about to make my good and get out when the girl said but there is one thing that is ever so to me why what is that that dead child s name what did you say it was here was another place to be in i had forgotten the child s name i hadn t imagined it would be needed again however i had to pretend to know anyway so i said joseph william the youth at my side corrected me and said no thomas henry i thanked him  in words  and said with oh yes  i was thinking of another child that i named  i have named a great many and i get them confused  this one was named henry  thomas henry calmly interposed the boy i thanked him again  strictly in words  and stammered out thomas henry  yes thomas henry was the men and things poor child s name i named him for thomas  er  thomas the great author you know  and henry  er  er  henry the eighth the parents were very grateful to have a child named thomas henry that makes it more singular than ever my beautiful friend does it why because when the parents speak of that child now they always call it that my i could not say anything i was entirely out of verbal to go further would be to lie and that i would not do so i simply sat still and suffered  sat and there and  for i was being slowly to death in my own presently the enemy laughed a happy laugh and said i have enjoyed this talk over old times but you have not i saw very soon that you were only pretending to know me and so as i had wasted a compliment on you in the beginning i made up my mind to punish you and i have succeeded pretty well i was glad to see that you knew george and tom and for i have never heard of them before and therefore could not be sure that you had and i was glad to learn the names of those imaginary children top one can get quite a fund of information out of you if one goes at it cleverly mary and the storm and the sweeping away of the forward boats were facts  all the rest was fiction mary was my best funny stories sister her full name was mary now do you remember me yes i said i do remember you now and you are as hard hearted as you were thirteen years ago in that ship else you wouldn t have punished me so you haven t changed your nature nor your person in any way at all you look as as you did then you are just as as you were then and you have a deal of your to this fine boy there  if that speech moves you any let s fly the flag of with the understanding that i am conquered and confess it all of which was agreed to and accomplished on the spot when i went back to i said now you see what a person with talent and address can do excuse me i see what a person of colossal ignorance and simplicity can do the idea of your going and on a party of strangers that way and talking for half an hour why i never heard of a man in his right mind doing such a thing before what did you say to them i never said any harm i merely asked the girl what her name was i don t doubt it upon my word i don t i think you are capable of it it was stupid in me	helen-mathers

dialogue and incident a translation from a drama called up into three volumes with the moral reflections of the distinguished etc now the above statement having obtained a large perhaps it may be as well to compare it with the truth of a three volume novel so composed as he has described two thirds must be moral reflections so small is the bulk of a play compared with that of a novel well the volumes of white lies are before me i find a page and a half of political reflection a page and a quarter on half a page on napoleon i a moral paragraph on suicide and another on women etc and a fragment or two the work is seven hundred and sixty eight pages my moral reflections are not two pages i doubt if they are more than one all the author s reflections together and it is the author s reflections he is talking of may be six pages compare this with the impression this liar has sought to create such bold are uttered in a sentence to them fully would take pages let us apply for once in a way scientific criticism the test i propose is one the value and severity of which will strike every man who knows the a b c of that science it is a test that would at once be fatal to all your

sheets were no doubt submitted to him by the and he selected for his pencil what his experience told him were the most dramatic and telling incidents i put the s name opposite each of these situations selected by mr the story begins july no vol xxv the title to each illustration has been supplied i conclude by mr and the soldiers this is a situation of five figures  watching and three figures  the

obtaining leave of absence from two figures  the from three figures  interview between de and two figures  return of to three figures  imploring s forgiveness three figures  the eighth not illustrated under those circumstances i beg to state there is not one syllable in the whole number nor one idea that is to be found in making his arrangements three figures  reading s letter five very skilful mr

the poison om six figures  the return of and la to  the you see is small the invention large by comparison by the word it was intended to convey that i have here stolen french ideas as my do and those they praise instead of them like an honest this too has been echoed far and wide compare with this statement made and repeated by writers who have not access to my kitchen far less to my heart what the author of himself wrote to me on the point in de paris mr dear est et your warm heart etc  all this to a translation of it is too late to mend je h proposition de pour la du un gentleman j un a

came into operation the london had declined the play and it became waste paper on my hands on this to me as per treaty i took it for i am not a generous person at all nor in money matters but only one who as fairly with authors as with i was still out of pocket and my work two acts of which were original i could not afford to lose my money still less my labour was it just i should come now i determined therefore to build a story on the basis of my rejected ms but as this was throwing the theatre over altogether i thought it fair in that case to repay the he had and indeed die wish to be able to do so with justice to myself had some influence in setting me to work i worked twelve months on this novel of white lies sound the small of such incidents in as were fit for a story i a whole web of original invention and i did what no englishman ever did since the nation existed i bought those few incidents for my story of the french instead of them as others do who escape abuse from because and thieves understand one another then it has been urged by others with more and a great deal more courtesy that i ought to have announced this work as an from a french original these

old man s enthusiasm there is one strange thing he said after a pause seeing that my parents were married so near london i cannot understand how the marriage was not discovered before looked thoughtful also it is strange he admitted but you remember the tale of s letter people always look in the most unlikely places first and because the church was so near to town and nobody had replied to the advertisement they  the i mean  must have thought that the marriage took place in some parish where people never looked at the journals it was the very of church to london george that prevented the being discovered sooner i suppose you are right said but it does seem strange everything in life is strange said and not the least strange thing is that i kick out walter to make room for you by the way george he will be here soon have you told him yes and he wants to see you about the matter i said that he could in my presence what he has to say i don t know there is another reason for your remaining george mrs ward and her daughter are coming here she won t be pleased to see me said oh i think she will after ireland put her in a corner she grew afraid and now she would like to see the matter settled at any price when she is your mother in law george keep her out of your house or there will be trouble you must stand sir she won t come near me then the turning of the lane that s true she is afraid of me i hold that you see and i know about her doings at san the said with great vigor i wonder that her daughter is so charming so good you mean said george fondly gave a sigh oh love and love said he it seems i am going to have a most sentimental time with you two be at rest sir neither nor i am sentimental we are too serious for that that s worse i hate serious lovers then we will be gay said george with a laugh don t it replied with a kindly smile be as you are both of you and i shall not complain ah here is walter well my boy have you come to see your new cousin walter entered the library with an injured air he looked and more fragile than ever and wonderfully old considering his years looked from him to the fine figure of with a queer look in his eyes no one would ever take you for relatives he said why they say we are like one another said walter mrs ward remarked on the likeness when we dined with her i wondered why we should resemble one another but it is explained now and walter cast a not look in his cousin s direction george is like me and you take after your father walter who was a if ever there was one george hastened to the rescue of his cousin it seems to me that the conversation is getting somewhat personal he remarked walter i hope you bear me no grudge for stepping into y k the yellow walter took the hand in his own limp well of course it is hard on a fellow he answered in a rather manner but you and i got on well together so i would rather it was you than another fellow that train friend of yours for instance he s such a but a very good fellow for all that said oh people always say that of a fellow who has nothing to recommend him retorted walter but as you are to be the head of the family i am glad you are not a that s very kind of you said george and very silly of walter growled the grandfather what do you mean sir by talking rubbish is it likely that any one of my blood would be what you call a no said walter the old man i only mean never mind what you mean it s sure to be something foolish this said pointing with his cane to george is the future head of our family pay him all respect we ll get on said clapping walter on the back and what about my income asked walter you will have what you have now said don t bother me about the matter you and can settle it between you considering how he had been walter really took things very calmly but he had not enough vigor to protest he sighed his grandfather had him and walter profoundly admired his newly found cousin who did to stand up to the he began to think it was a good thing that george had come into the family he would t least s ve from constant the turning of the lane this interesting family council was interrupted by the entrance of mrs ward as and pretty as ever she had quite recovered her spirits and know ing that would say nothing about the card or about the san matter she was prepared to be as insolent as she dared but she was quite determined not to cross swords again with the old man like a burnt child she dreaded the fire was altogether too much even for her as it was she came sailing in with the prettiest air in the world and held out both hands her head on one side like a sick my dear lord how well you are looking how  here her astonished eyes fell on george you said mrs ward aghast mr and here not mr said enjoying her confusion but my george who had remained below to give some instructions to the footman entered the room just in time to hear this announcement she flew to her lover my dearest	mark-twain

dirty houses of two or three rooms each the streets of dwellings are as mean and ugly as those of shops are brilliant and picturesque this is a meagre outline of what may be called the of this ancient city which dates from the fourth century b c when it was walled only by a of and mud but was known by the name of the martial city of the south changed later into the city of at this date it has probably greater importance than it ever had and no city but london me so much with the idea of solid wealth and increasing prosperity my admiration and amazement never cease i grudge the hours that i am obliged to spend in sleep a week has gone like half a day each hour my impressions of the fascination and interest of and of the singular force and importance of the chinese is from its colour novelty and movement to day i have been carried eighteen miles through and round it the whole letter m oriental time in its and drinking for the first time of that water of which it may truly be said that drinks shall thirst again  true as we sat at mid day at the five which from a comer of the outer wall the city and ever since through this crowded week i have wished that the sun would stand still in the sky and let me dream of gorgeous sunlight light without heat of narrow lanes rich in colour of the of sunlight on and cloth of gold even in the darkness of hurrying and coloured crowds in the shadow with the blue sky in narrow high above of gorgeous marriage and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride of glittering trains of of funeral with the wail of hired clad in and

sight seeing almost the first sight that i saw on arriving in this quarter which is in itself was a number of christian old men women and children who having fled from a bloody persecution which is being against christianity about ninety miles from are receiving shelter in the compound of the german mission it was late in the evening and these poor who had sacrificed much for their faith and had undergone great terror were singing hymns and reading and in chinese in the place from which they came a christian of wealth wished to build a church and last week he was proceeding to do so when the heathen by the district seized upon him and four other christians and when he would neither say the word nor make the which is regarded as equivalent to denying christ they wrapped him in cotton soaked in oil tied him to a cross and burned him no extremity of torture to shake his constancy they cut off the arms and legs of the four other persons tied crosses to the trunks and then burned them this deed done so near has caused great horror among the foreigners both here and at and the deepest sympathy the golden letter iv is felt both with the and the missionary priests in the sympathy with the heroism and of those who have been faithful unto death all the join heartily as in the belief that these victims are reckoned among the noble army of it is estimated that there are seven hundred and fifty thousand christians in china many of them of the third or fourth generation of christians and in some places far in the interior there are whole villages of them the and french missionary priests who devote themselves for life to this work dress eat and live as and are with great devotion it is most interesting to be brought by the spectacle of these poor so near to the glory and the woe of and to hear that the martyr spirit can still make men obedient unto death even the death of the cross a was posted up some time ago calling for a general of the native christians on christmas day it attributes every vice to the foreign devils and says that to preserve the peace and purity of chinese society those whom they have must be cut off one phrase of this is the wickedness of these

over on the grass with his heels his little companion flashed off in the moonlight and wa over the wall in a as for me i sat yelling at the pitch of my lungs and nursing one of my legs which felt as if a red hot ring were round it it was not long as may be imagined before the whole household from the head master to the stable boy was out in the garden with lamps and the matter was soon cleared the man carried off on a and i borne in much state and solemnity to a special bedroom where the small bone of my leg was set by surgeon  the younger of the two brothers of that name as to the robber it was found that his legs were and the doctors were of two minds as to whether he would recover the use of them or not but the law never gave them a chance of settling the matter for he was hanged after some six weeks later it was proved that he the great shadow was the most desperate rogue in the north of land for he had done three at the least and there were charges enough against him upon the sheet to have hanged him ten times over well now i could not pass over my boyhood without telling you about this which was the most important thing that happened to me but i will go off upon no more side tracks for when i think of all that is coming i can see very well that i shall have more than enough to do before i have finished for when a man has only his own uttle private tale to tell it often takes him all his time but when he gets mixed up in such great matters as i shall have to speak about then it is hard on him if he has not been brought up to it to get it all set down to his liking but my memory is as good as ever thank god and i shall try to get it all straight before i finish it was this business of the that first made a friendship between jim the doctor s son and me he was cock boy of the school from the day he came for within the hour he had thrown who had been cock before him right through the big black board in the jim always ran to muscle and bone and even then he was square and tall short of speech and long in the arm much given to lounging with his broad back against walls and his hands deep in his breeches pockets i can even recall that he had a trick of keeping a straw in the comer of his mouth just where he used afterwards to hold his the night op the pipe jim was always the same for good and for bad since first i knew him heavens how we all looked up to him i we were but young savages and had a savage s respect for power there was tom of who could write as well as mere and yet nobody would give a snap for tom and there was who had every date from the killing of on the tip of his tongue so that the masters themselves would turn to him if they were in doubt yet he was but a narrow lad over long for his breadth and what did his dates help him when jack of the lower third him down the passage with the end of a but you didn t do things like that with jim what tales we used to whisper about his strength how he put his fist through the oak of the game room door how when long was the ball he caught up ball and all and ran swiftly past every opponent to the goal it did not seem fit to us that such a one as he should trouble his head about and or care to know who signed the when he said in open class that king was the man we little boys all felt that very likely it was so and that perhaps jim knew more about it than the man who wrote the book well it was this business of the that drew his attention to me for he patted me on my head and said that i was a little devil the great shadow which blew me out with pride for a week on end for two years we were close friends for all the gap that the years had made between us and though in passion or in want of thought he did many a thing that me yet i loved him like a brother and wept as much as would have filled an ink bottle when at last after two years he went off to to study his father s profession five years after that did i bide at s and when i left had become cock myself for i was as and as tough as though i never ran to weight and like my great it was in year that i left s and then for three years i stayed at home learning the ways of the cattle but still the ships and the armies were and still the great shadow of lay across the country how could i guess that i too should have a hand in lifting that shadow for ever from our people u chapter n cousin of some years before when i was still but a lad there had come over to us upon a five weeks visit the only daughter of my father s brother had settled at as a maker of and he had made more out of than ever we were like to do out of the bushes and sand links of west inch so his daughter came over	edith-wharton

gown of which seemed to constitute her only garment her bare feet were as brown as her hands but her face was considerably lighter than her husband s or indeed any of the natives about her as soon as the limits of the village were reached all of the horses were into a gentle felt the of the ride and of the delightful air as in that month of march as it would be in the best part of a northern june

long have you been married she asked the guide been marry ten week ten week marry to my li l wife an had no child en could not help laughing outright to miss giddy save his life but looked at him with the same immovable gravity he had hitherto shown with vexation and for some time left the conversation to the men of the party however the subject of the guide s wife could not quite be dropped and she ventured to enter upon it again after a time your wife is much than any of your people she must have white people s blood in her the guide listened attentively look it he answered restrained his laughter this time and the horses were urged again into a it was said to be ten miles to the cave but it was a long road for that distance very little of it was shaded in the least the only people met on the way were donkey men with loads of wood on the backs of their beasts the poverty of the country it was learned that these loads which consumed a long day in cutting and conveying to the town brought only thirty to fifty cents and part of this had to be paid to the inexorable owner of the mountain side or the authorities the donkey men were and poorly clad but they saluted the with polite expressions and were doubtless contented with their lot all of them seemed to know the guides it was noon when the reached the bottom of the mountain in which the de la was asked if they would like to stop here for lunch before attempting the climb but both and miss strange said they preferred reaching the mouth of the cave before breaking their the virgin s merely to rest their animals for a few minutes they were soon again in the saddle and upon the upward road and now began one of the most tiresome of journeys the cave entrance was at least four thousand feet away by the winding path from the valley the road was paved with rolling stones which not only gathered no moss but made a most footing for the horses sometimes it was doubtful whether the beasts advanced or after taking a forward step responded to all suggestions that they were quite used to it and that they had made the journey many times before all roads have an end and in an hour after starting from the base of the hill the reached their destination and saw the opening of the cave just above them both were under the hot sun of midday and very glad to again the assistant who had come with took off the and the horses near

them no had been brought and except for what branches they might break from the of the mountain side they were not likely to get anything to her blank look replied that the guide was right according

business a large share mr understands of the time mrs spent a good many evenings out but rarely mentioned that she was going until she had her on you will have to entertain you she would remark to her husband at the door meals were served almost literally at all hours rose a long time after george had gone to his office it was not much like her own marriage mrs drew thought often with a sigh how different this house would be if we only had a baby exclaimed one evening when they had lived in this manner the larger part of a year he and mrs drew were sitting alone i don t believe a man ever

who have more children than they desire pursued when he had partially recovered his and there are others who cannot have them no matter how they wish it heaven is very in its blessings i do not see how the priests can claim that god is a beneficent being shocked at what sounded to her like mrs drew rose to leave the room as she passed the chamber that mrs was accustomed to occupy she saw that the door stood wide open th out of pity so strongly aroused for the husband overcame her completely with the step of a she entered the room and took something from the then she walked slowly back to

before him he realized from s excited manner that something unusual was her lifting the to his nostrils he slowly he was a and when he turned his gaze again upon his companion he uttered the word poison where did you find this he added do not answer at once already frightened at what she had done mrs drew shut her pale lips tightly together you got that in mrs s room he said with a wild look what could she have bought it for suicide no murder the words had escaped her lips uttered by an impulse she could not resist he stared at her with dilated eyes all his customary courtesy vanished give it back to me she cried starting up suddenly give it back to me i was mad to touch it i did not know what i was doing please oh i please give it back i will he answered severely when i have examined further into its nature and have learned for what use it was intended why did you bring among the it to me if you intended to surround it with all this mystery oh i have made an awful mistake she cried weeping if you value your peace of mind in this life your hope of heaven give it back to me his only answer was to motion her rudely to leave the room then he went to the place where his were kept it was hours later when he finished his investigation but the truth dawned upon him at last when drew met at breakfast the next morning she saw that she could tell him nothing he had the look of a wild animal that has scented its prey and means to it with stealthy step till it is brought to earth chapter vii among the each day now made drew more uncomfortable while she could never bring herself to the subject with mr it always stood between them like the ghost of mr drew who was a comfortable good natured fellow had but one creed in the world which was that his wife was the

village at least for the present and expressing the hope that her aunt would think better of it later and come to see her she said she would not ask forgiveness feeling conscious of no wrong but trusted that the of her action would be excused as the circumstances of her husband s business had made haste necessary before night every person in knew of the affair and for the next and more it

he might be willing to adopt she knew her fault had struck him a blow from which his proud nature would never recover as for the mother while she in her ignorance of the facts would suffer less there was something in deliberate deceit to that loving and indulgent relation that of the deepest and to this must now be added the of another person to all this there said gray forcing a smile to his face

consideration in judging of the of the accuracy of any statement which is made on the whole however there were not many complaints uttered and these were usually of the of law some were spoken of with something akin to enthusiasm one had built a bridge another had made a good road a third had restored a temple a fourth was very charitable to the poor and in the last had diminished the luxury of his own table by a half that he might feed the poor and so on anything like an enlightened idea on a subject not local was not to be hoped for few of these had heard of the war or of the peace of and those who had believed that the had been driven into the sea or into fiery holes in the ground the immense paid to the roman for their losses in the touched them more closely and i heard a good deal said regarding the roman which i will not repeat and i will also keep dark the various some of them most and amusing which were made on our own only wishing that the were gi ed us to see ourselves as

second day after leaving we had heavy rain all day and the road which was a barely track mostly on slippery mud hills was so infamous that as the were constantly slipping and even falling i had to do a good deal of being hauled and lifted along walking it was not for my feet slipped from under me at nearly every step we passed through one vacant forlorn city of refuge and spent most of the day in a desolate inhabited red region along the side of a high bleak mountain ridge the summit of which an of feet we gained at dark to find a small and most miserable hamlet on the top of it the houses were all shut and the pouring rain kept indoors no wonder the was over my ankles and very cold a broad gleam fell across the road and we made our way to it as wet as it was possible to be and took rather than asked shelter in a big shed with a or platform at one side lighted as well as filled with smoke by some branches which were being burned in a great clay furnace apparently used for the making of iron pots several men were coal into the same and there was a prospect of warmth this shed was the front of the mouth and workings of a coal pit i was guided into some workings which appeared where there were some pigs a sunk water in the clay floor and an two feet six inches wide by six feet long into which my six feet six inches long was backed and projected six inches outside after a hot supper i rolled myself in my wet clothes in a dry rug and slept soundly till the torrent of rain off at eight the following morning when we got on the road again chapter xxiv to fu the weather continued grim cold and damp with a penetrating east wind i felt the cold more than on any previous journey even when for weeks at a time the had below and on this occasion it never fell below  above and on some of the days was as high as  men who had them were wearing their handsome up to march th after leaving the coal pit and the bleak we descended to a region where the natural terrace formation of the hills was aided by art and the country looked as if it were covered with roman at the risk of my readers i must again remark on the of the formation of this large portion of the red basin which is continued in its most exaggerated form at least as far south as on the fully south of looking down from any height it is seen that the red has been into hundreds of small hills from to feet high with their sides worn into natural and very regular of which i have counted twenty three one above another while the actual is into a most resemblance to a fort or ruined castle much of is remarkable for the of villages but on the other hand it is dotted over both with large where the farmer and his live in style surrounded by a wall with a heavy and with large cottages the walls of which with their heavy black and walls have a most distinct resemblance to the old architecture while the roofs with a nearly even slope from the ridge pole to the extremity of the deep which form

trail  they sprang toward me followed the line with his eye he galloped forward with a look of triumph by l o suddenly i saw him fling himself half out of his saddle and clutch at some object still going at speed and holding on by one leg alone after the indian fashion for sport or shelter against an arrow or a shot he picked up something from the bushes regained his seat and waved his treasure to us we ranged up and rode beside him over a gap in the sage a lady s glove  that was what he had stooped to recover an old riding neatly about the wrist and on the a pretty glove strangely almost feminine in this desolation a well worn glove that had seen better days like its mistress but never any day so good as this when it proved to us that we were on the sure path of rescue i take up the said k qui le we said nothing more for this unconscious token this silent for help made the danger seem more closely imminent we pressed on no in any of the horses where we could we were going at speed where they could the horses kept side by side each other companionship sustained them in that terrible ride and now in front the purple was growing brown and rising up a distinct wall visibly with and the saw teeth of the ridge defined themselves sharply into peak and broad fields of cool snow gleamed upon the we were ascending now all the time into regions we crossed great sloping deep in dry rustling grass where a nation of cattle might pasture we plunged through broad of hot sand we flung ourselves down and up the red sides of water worn we took leaps across dry in the clay we across stony longing for the of water that had flowed there not many months before the trail was plain no craft was needed to trace it here the chase had gone but a few hours ago here across grassy slopes the grass as if a had passed that way here wearily through the sand here treading the red crumbling clay here breaking down the side of a bank here leaving a sharp track in the dry mud of a fled torrent everywhere a straight path pointing for that deepening gap in the alley the only gate of escape by s judgment had divined the course aright on he led charging along the trail as if he were already on the of the pursued on he led and we followed drawing nearer nearer to our goal our horses suffered bitterly for water some five hours we had ridden without a pause not one drop or sign of water in all that arid waste the torrents had poured along the dry too hastily to let the scanty and along their line treasure up any sap of growth the wild sage bushes had plainly never tasted more than seldom out on certain rare days enough to keep their meagre foliage a dusty gray no pleasant anywhere under the long dry grass of the the were and hot as in it became to listen to the panting and gasping of our horses their eyes grew staring and we suffered ourselves hardly less than they it was cruel to press on but we must hinder a cruelty love against time  vengeance against time we must

say  see this is my endurance i hold my power ready still to show and he curved his proud neck shook his mane like a banner and galloped the of all we came to a broad strip of sand the dry bed of a mountain torrent the trail followed up this path heavy for the tired horses how would they bear the rough work down the yet to come suddenly our leader pulled up and sprang from the saddle look he cried how those fellows spent their time and saved ours thank heaven for this we shall save her surely now they had dug a pit deep in the thirsty sand and found a lurking river buried there nature never questioned what manner of men they were that sought flying from vengeance and planning now another villain outrage  still impartial nature did not change her laws for them sunshine air water ufe  these of hers  she gave them freely that higher by l o boon of death if they were to receive it must be from some other power greater than the force of nature good luck and good omen this well of water in the sand it proved that our chase had as we and had been delayed as we before they had dared to pause and waste moments here their horses must have been drooping terribly the pit was nearly five feet deep a good hour s work and no less had dug it with such tools as they could bring i almost laughed to think of the two slowly out the sliding sand with a tin plate perhaps and a pan while a score of miles away upon the desert we three were riding hard upon their tracks to follow them the for this refreshment they had left non i was ready to say triumphantly but then i remembered the third figure in their group  a woman like a growing calmer as her peril grew  and seemed to withdraw and the pang of this picture crushed back into my heart any thoughts but a mad anxiety and a frenzy

mr she had in the suggestion that should remain with her for a day or two until he could find her a situation with the understanding that all relations but those of friendship should cease between

at least whom hereditary introduced to his notice felt in that presence as a child might have felt in pan for the poet himself these lingering years were full of grave of humble self judgment of hopeful looking to the end worldly minded i am not he wrote to an intimate friend near his life s close  on the contrary my wish to benefit those within my humble sphere seemingly in exact proportion to my inability to realize those wishes what i lament most is that the of my nature does not and rise the nearer i approach the grave as yours does and as it with my beloved partner the aged poet might feel the loss of some of emotion but his thoughts dwelt more and more constantly on the beloved ones who had gone before him and on the true and unseen world one of the images which to his friends is that of the old man as he would stand against the window of the dining room at mount and read the and lessons for the day of the tall bowed figure and the silvery hair of the deep voice which always faltered when among the prayers he came to the words which give thanks for those who have departed this life in thy faith and fear  retirement then might look upon a soothing scene age steal to his allotted nook contented and serene by l oo william with heart as calm as lakes that sleep in frosty moonlight glistening or mountain torrents where they creep along a channel smooth and deep to their own far off murmurs listening  among all s of the blessed it is the who are the truest friends of man we need not be ashamed to linger on them fondly to imagine between the impression which one or another poet makes on us with the sights or sounds the or of the great open world shakespeare one may say is like daylight and like the furnace glow is like storm and like the thunder and like the moving sea is like wine and like water  which said was best often that drink seems flat enough but let the wounded soldier crawl to the well spring and he knows that water is best indeed it is the very life of men i note  william was bom of old north country stock on the th of april at in the neither at school nor at college was he distinguished as a scholar filled with enthusiasm for the french revolution he spent a year in paris whence he was driven by the reign of terror from until his death he lived almost in the lake country the record of his secluded and happy life being found in his poems he died at mount on the d of april lines composed a few miles above abbey on the banks of the during a tour five years have passed five with the length of long and again i hear these waters rolling from their mountain springs with a soft inland murmur once again do i behold these steep and lofty cliffs that on a wild secluded scene impress by william thoughts of more deep seclusion and connect the landscape with the quiet of the sky the day is come when i again repose here under this dark and view these plots of cottage ground these orchard which at this season with their fruits are clad in one green hue and lose themselves mid groves and once again i see these hedge rows  hardly hedge rows  little lines of wood run wild these pastoral farms green to the very door and wreaths of smoke sent up in silence from among the trees with some uncertain notice as might seem of in the woods or of some s cave where by his fire the sits alone these forms through a long absence have not been to me as is a landscape to a blind man s eye but oft in lonely rooms and mid the din of towns and cities i have owed to them in hours of weariness sensations sweet felt in the blood and felt along the heart and passing even into my purer mind with tranquil restoration feelings too of pleasure such perhaps as have no slight or trivial influence on that best portion of a good man s life  his little nameless acts of kindness and of love nor less i trust to them i may have owed another gift of aspect more sublime that blessed mood in which the of the mystery in which the heavy and the weary weight of all this unintelligible world is lightened that serene and blessed mood in which the affections gently lead us on until the breath of this frame and even the motion of our human blood almost suspended we are laid asleep in body and become a living soul while with an eye made quiet by the power of harmony and the deep power of joy we see into the life of things by l william if this be but a vain belief yet oh how oft  in darkness and amid the many shapes of daylight when the stir and the fever of the world have hung upon the of my heart  how oft in spirit have i turned to thee thou wanderer through the woods how often has my spirit turned to thee and now with of half extinguished thought with many dim and faint and somewhat of a sad perplexity the picture of

of and honesty party lines were everywhere being broken through by men who found conviction stronger than party and tom himself felt his heart burn within him at the consciousness that the support he was to give his cousin was a direct of his sincere belief to be honest he must have who was set aside almost solely because the large interest which tom represented was supporting the latter there had been a good deal of by richard but tom s influence and tom s millions had everywhere been his card had an inherited place in the boston political world and in this particular matter no other man s word was of so much weight as his so that he felt to o in the bundle of time the full the responsibility of the he was to make which although would practically settle the matter richard had taken his seat opposite his cousin and with sparkling of lights of and of laughter the dinner went on tom could not eat and with gloomy eyes he looked down the table from his seat on the right of the eminent who presided his money paid for this feast at which he sat so unwillingly and to which he was brought to offer up his political honor as one more sacrifice to the of his tyrant his was almost it seemed to him that he must break out in some desperate deed he replied mechanically to what was said to him his face like a mask assuming a smile at the numerous which flew faster and faster he thought of and how she would despise him if she knew he had never dared tell her the truth but with painfully wrought excuses had explained the delay of their marriage until even her perfect faith was strained to wonder sitting at the feast to night tom ground his teeth and cursed the fate which made him wrong the heart that trusted him he looked across at his a political dinner cousin whose sallow cheek was flushed with triumph and a bitter leaped to his lips at the bondage in which he was held  an old purpose long cherished took new shape in his mind suppose he should rise in his place and lay bare all his whole wretched story to the honorable gentlemen dining here after all the ordeal seemed less dreadful than to stand up before them as for his cousin whatever was noble in his soul asserted itself and he sat more erect as his determination took form he might lose all that was dearest to him he shivered and set his teeth together at the thought of going out from this brilliant company a disgraced and man the impossibility of making them believe in the innocence of his intentions in writing that check came over him like a blast of icy air that these men who had all his life given to him the honor which belonged to a member of the proud old family into which he had been born should to morrow ever and ever after look when he encountered them seemed to him a punishment too terrible for human nature to endure the friends of his fine old father the companions of his college days the men he knew and in the bundle of time liked at the club all seemed to come in review before him passing his mental self as he sat there in the gay over the wine with averted faces and mien to confess seemed to him to mean the of all honor and all happiness he could not explain  could he even persuade he could only rise in his place and confess what he had done and that he had borne the burden of it so long that it was intolerable to bear it longer he would not even richard he thought with a of contempt behind which perhaps lay some subtle self if those who heard could and did read between the lines of his story that was not his concern he would not even mention his cousin s name but he almost groaned aloud as he thought of her to tell the truth meant giving her up and he reflected bitterly that not even the fact that he had never been so worthy of her as this confession would make him could not change the fact that he could not ask her to unite her with those of a man disgraced he would be worthy of her he said to himself even if he lost her he would not add to his the crime of being false in this public act it a political dinner was in no small degree a sense that to night he was acting in a sort of public capacity which gave him the firmness to hold to the resolution to speak the vital force which despite all corruption all and all selfishness does still live in our free institutions for every honest man strengthened him to go forward he might perhaps have lacked resolution to make this supreme sacrifice of himself had private issues been at stake but in his mind a throb of that patriotism which is the hope of the country woke all the nobility and fire of his soul whatever may have been the weakness or wickedness of his previous hfe he was at this moment truly and nobly a hero he set his teeth together and waited what he had to say in his mind and mingling it with the words in which he meant to tell the whole naked truth to at last the dinner meanwhile wore on and almost before tom realized it the air was full of cigar smoke and the for the evening was on his feet what he said poor tom could not have told had his life depended upon it he smiled to himself with dry lips as he fancied what would be the	charles-dickens

this man who had done so much for her rising she put her arms around his neck as she had done a hundred times in younger years and laid her fair cheek to his for a few moments he did not move then he

your presence said the letter but now that i am able to call pen and paper to my assistance i can no longer repress them within the past week i have learned that life without you would be even my unfortunate condition and without a permanent situation of any kind cannot keep me from telling you the truth it seems to reveal the state of my feelings when i have no home to offer but i may not

different from that which had been growing up so rapidly in her bosom for was the first young man with whom she had ever come in contact her secluded life left her ready to find perfection in any well appearing person of the opposite sex if sufficiently and attractive but for she had a much more powerful emotion during the hours she had spent in his company she had longed earnestly for some spoken word to indicate that her feeling toward him was returned the least expression telling of his love would have to let loose the full tide of her own affection and now when his su and departure had filled her with alarm and came this sweet proof of all she could ask her happiness was so great that for a few days she did not even communicate the news to three letters came in quick succession from the third one saying he should return on the following evening the maid was told to be on the watch for him and before he arrived had told her all happy at anything that pleased her young mistress rejoiced also as soon as appeared on the premises he was taken into s presence and left alone with her there was a second of hesitation and then the fair girl allowed her lover to take her in his arms you do really forgive me then murmured lots at seventy who wore a haggard look as of one who has passed sleepless nights for answer she gave him her lips to kiss he needed no other have you been doing anything wrong asked as soon as she could speak wrong he repeated with a dazed look yes mr has been here inquiring for you he says are looking for you in all directions then she told him the entire conversation she had had with mr in the library as far as she could recall it give you my word he answered breathing more easily that i have done nothing of which you would not approve don t tell me darling that you lost faith in me the girl embracing him again declared that such a supposition was the farthest possible thing from the truth but even though he were a criminal she protested she could do no less than love him i have thought so much of the dangers we run she added that everything me oh i wish we could be married at once then whatever happened they could not tear us apart the young man gazed at her with tenderness what an innocent flower she was to open her full heart to him i wish it as heartily as you my love he said if i had any money i could call my own i would ask you to run away with me this very night when off to we had found a minister and were made one we could laugh at all their threats and the idea of an completely fascinated the girl to go away with him to

in the mess room was then called up by the captain who was too mi ch interested in the search to permit the first by the yankee or ant to carry on the investigation the malignant little wretch presented himself but he stuck to his former text that he knew nothing about mr and had not seen him since he left the at one bell in the dog watch you had a dispute with him said the captain a little replied what was it about about putting on airs i believe or something of that kind mr was present sir mr was appealed to but he had all that about exposing his to punishment even if guilty which among sailors and school boys he did not deny mr s statement but he was fully resolved on his own account to bring the to justice if did not soon appear were there any hard words passed between you demanded the captain no hard words but there was some rather strong language used by both of us k mr had any further information he would  not impart it the master was examined once more he was positive the keys of the after hold had been returned to him by mr within ten minutes after he took them it was useless therefore to examine the hold and the search was sorrowfully abandoned but there were some sleepless eyes in the that night by ic the adventures of a naval officer r chapter xii in darkness he keys of the hold are the especial charge of the master it is never opened except in presence of a suitable officer who is responsible for any neglect or carelessness of which the party taking out stores may be guilty had been sent down to attend to this duty he had delivered the stores or rather seen them delivered and in order to be sure that everything was right he had stepped within the door to make a careful survey of the place he had scarcely done so when the door was suddenly upon him he was in total darkness for he had left the lantern outside that he might the better detect any appearance of fire within the store room his way back to the door but found that it was locked of course he was greatly annoyed and astonished at the blunder some one had made but it was a mistake which must shortly be corrected he concluded that mr brown the sailing master had come below himself and finding the store room open had by the yankee om closed it and gone on deck to find the officer who had thus neglected his duty he would soon return and an explanation would make the matter all right mr brown did not return no one came to release him from his dark prison house the mistake began to appear unaccountable to him he made some experiments with his voice which however seemed to be as they did not bring the needed relief from above it was no use to fret about his situation which he i as by no means desperate at the worst he co d only spend the night there and some one would release him in the morning if a call happened to be made for stores it was a dark disagreeable place in which to spend the night but as that was the best which could be done he decided to content himself with the situation the hours wore away very slowly but imagined himself in holding a of for and his fancy easily changed the gloomy apartment into the pleasant parlor of from there he went to and sat for an hour in the kitchen talking with his father and mother about the and wondering how he could contrive to tell them about the fair young lady who always called him a but after all the dark hold was neither the parlor at nor the kitchen at and in spite of his vivid fancy he was occasionally brought to a sense that he by the adventures of a naval officer was surrounded by boxes and bags and at an early hour he made his bed on the floor and in due time went to sleep his sublime philosophy enabled him to accomplish this feat without any very severe exertions the bed was very hard and he had not been accustomed to it on a plank so he up several times during the night but a careful consideration of his position each time he went to sleep again on the whole he passed a tolerably comfortable night though he would have preferred to be in his berth in the or with his watch on deck he did not regard himself as a martyr and did not make any set statement of his sufferings wherewith to his after his escape morning came though in the deep gloom of the hold was not conscious of the fact he had slept all he could and being a resolute he concluded from this fact that it must be daylight but after hour passed away and no one came for stores and the darkness frowned upon him as savagely as ever he could not hear the bells on deck though the occasional footstep of an officer in the ward room was audible in the mean time captain was greatly distressed about the absence of his young officer on one occasion had saved his life and he was as grateful as one man could be to another for this service in by the yankee or addition to this fact the was a splendid fellow in his estimation and for this reason alone he could not afford to lose he had not slept half as well in his comfortable cabin as had on the soft side of the pine plank which formed his bed a careful consideration of all the circumstances and a careful weighing of all	isabella-lucy-bird

noticing it but science has everything to do with it it is science that is going to make the future great it is science that has distance and the has just begun twenty years ago it was hardly possible for a man standing on one side of the street to make himself heard on the other the properties of the atmosphere not being w hat they should be today you can stand in the pulpit of your church and by

can be brought within range of the ear why cannot be brought before the mind s eye and if can be brought before the mind s eye what is to prevent the invention of a which shall enable us to cast a w

the aid of my sees that on a certain date in the future he w ill be hanged for murder is going to fail to provide himself with an in regard to that particular murder and must we not admit that having provided himself with that he will of necessity avoid and so avoid the gallows that s reasonable so in regard to all the thousand and one other that go to make this life a sinful one science by a purely logical advance along the lines already out for itself and in part already traversed will enable men to avoid the and reap only the of life we shall all sec what terrible consequences await on a single and we shall not make the can you still claim that science and the future have nothing to do with each other you are talking of matters purely said mr i have reference to our spiritual future and the two observed the idiot are so closely allied that we cannot separate them the proverb about looking after the and letting the pounds take care of themselves applies here i believe that if i take care of my future  which by does not exist  my spiritual future will take care of itself and if science places the hereafter before us  and you admit that even t r vo k library and foundations r l i now it is before us  all we have to do is to take advantage of our opportunities and mend our lives accordingly but if science shows you what is to come said the school master it must show your fate with perfect accuracy or it ceases to be science in which event your entertaining notions as to reform and so on are entirely not at all said the idiot we are approaching the time when science which is much more liberal than any other branch of knowledge will sacrifice even truth itself for the good of mankind you ought to start a company suggested the doctor either that or make himself the

handle was of black wood what then had become of the yellow handled knife which feared so greatly was too weary and ached too much with his late struggle to think over this problem he therefore postponed all consideration until next morning on reaching the prince s head he sat down to an excellent meal and held his peace about his adventures after dinner he drank some coffee and smoked a couple of pipes then he went to bed about ten o clock or a trifle later shortly in spite of the late excitement he fell asleep when he awoke it was nine o clock in the morning feeling somewhat bruised and stiff  for s grasp was like that of an  he decided to remain in bed instead of taking the morning train to london the afternoon train would do he decided so he rang for his breakfast to be served intending to rise at midday the took his orders for breakfast and seemed to be but before he could make inquiries she ran out of the room later mrs herself arrived with the breakfast tray and looked excited as she placed it on the bed oh mr she cried with shining eyes such terrible news that mad girl at the s house has murdered miss and has bolted it is impossible gasped starting up in bed the from has just brought the news sir the sealed message chapter xv a tragedy mrs news was so startling that could only fall back on his pillow and stare at her excited face pleased with the effect which she produced like all she continued rapidly to explain the s master  is his name  went at seven this morning with the milk to the s house miss always came to the gate and opened it to take the milk in he found the gate wide open and miss lying on the path within the grounds to the heart and as dead as a stone gave the alarm in the village and many people went into the grounds and up to examine the house they found no one there that poor lunatic was gone sent on his man to tell the police here and he came in for a drink i had the whole story out of him isn t it dreadful sir to think that we should have been talking of that crazy only yesterday and that she should commit so dreadful a crime stop said sharply and somewhat recovering himself you cannot say if miss is guilty mrs not say she is guilty why sir if she isn t who can be it s well known that miss as you call her sir always wanted to kill people and that was why she was shut up not being able to get at another person she has murdered poor miss who watched her and then ran away  to murder again i suppose oh how very dreadful it all is when i said yesterday that we might be murdered in our beds i little thought that we should be nonsense nonsense the sealed message begging your pardon sir but it s gospel truth that i am speaking said the landlady with a lunatic at large one never knows what may happen the police  and a very nice man he is  has already sent to asking major to go to is talking about things with blood and slaughter in them and i ask your pardon sir for having come into your bedroom but i thought you would like to know oh dear me dear me mrs wrung her plump hands and retreated towards the door in a condition bolt and bar every window and door at sunset no for me having herself out of the room she the door and sitting up in bed placed his hands on either side of his head to think matters over he found it difficult to believe the news and yet he might have expected to hear something of this sort of course he was absolutely certain that was innocent but he could not understand why she had run away nor could he guess who had slain the unfortunate italian quite unable to eat his breakfast because of the intelligence he jumped out of bed and into the hip bath which was in the centre of the room the sooner he went downstairs and learned all that could be learned the better able would he be to see his way if had been in danger from major before she was now in greater danger than ever as he assuredly would use her assumed guilt to prevent her the money nothing will make anyone believe that is other than guilty was the young man s her crazy reputation is enough if she is caught they will shut her up in an asylum notwithstanding the denial she is sure to make then will be able to keep the money according to the strict letter of the will and yet  and the sealed message yet he clenched his fist i believe that himself is guilty of the crime he had really no reason to make such an accusation but the happening of the crime was so for the major that it did not seem entirely impossible for him to have had a hand in it assuredly he might not have struck the blow himself but the could easily have been employed to remove not that on the face of it would wish to lose so useful a servant but if it was necessary that should be accused of murder to her being placed in an asylum was the nearest and most natural victim but these arguments were futile as reflected while dressing for he did not know exactly what had taken place it was necessary to learn when the crime had been

the very oldest families in the kingdom though his branch was a one which had separated from the northern some time in the sixteenth century and had established itself in western where the house of is perhaps the oldest inhabited building in the county something of his seemed to cling to the man and i never looked at his pale keen face or the of his head without him with grey and windows and all the venerable of a keep now and again we drifted into talk and i can remember that more than once he expressed a keen interest in my methods of observation and for four years i had seen nothing of him

children are few after a few of years it will result in china becoming altogether the of the world and both have associations for breaking off the habit their general object may be said to be that each member should control his as for the masters will not employ them as servants teachers will not have them as scholars will not take them as soldiers farmers will not use them as merchants will not employ them as w ill not have them for workmen this year the value of foreign goods imported amounted to more than eighty million the of chinese might be about fifty million or more the foreign i e was valued at more than thirty million thus there was a china is not by commerce but the im comes from the consumption of a serious question the writer by saying  if and were to live again and were

race t chapter notes on in china wo thousand four hundred and fifty eight workers including wives represent the missionary energies and the many divisions of the native number the shock which china received through her defeat by has produced among other results a disposition to make inquiries regarding the god faith and learning of those western from whom received the art of war although hostility to christianity as a destructive and power has been recently by the anti christian at ing and elsewhere the spirit of inquiry volume and expresses itself in large in street and churches the

as well as emphatic recognition by our own in one mission alone of the american board in another province the number of into the christian religion is estimated at the growing influence of

preaching conversation schools and the circulation of christian literature only differ slightly their knowledge of chinese is necessarily imperfect and they often make grotesque and even serious as their methods and mistakes in the language are much alike so too are their lives the keenest chinese critic finds no difference in conduct and the motives which rule it between the scotch in the china inland mission and etc in the church missionary society in the fu province and the german and american in these men and women are seen under the fierce light of criticism which beats upon them whether at home or abroad to lead pure just truthful kind honest virtuous patient lives temper and suffering long these lives preach a higher standard of living than is by the highest chinese teaching and by

mysterious manner bore our sins in his own body on the tree is he who is alive for and ever to make and that he hath death and brought life and immortality to light through his gospel this in brief is the teaching of all in china to whatever church they belong and with one or two exceptions all regard as an confession of faith and as the evidence of a complete break with the and of under such

again she sat at her window still white silent the hours had crushed heavily over her and spared her nothing not until now did she know not until now did she realize all that her husband had by k v t s been to her all that she had looked for from him all the hope that had the dark days of her imprisonment lit up her bare cell flushed its soft light over the court house that dreadful day the day that until now had been the most dreadful day of all her life a hundred eyes had been upon her had burnt into her soul  curious eyes searching eyes eyes all around all the air was alive with voices r voices that rose and fell monotonous persistent dreadful what were they saying now a sentence itself now another the prisoner guilty my lord the prisoner how curious it sounded the prisoner how should she know anything of prisoners dreadful creatures shameful lowering hideous she had dreamed of them in her happy childhood and shuddering had hidden her face in nurse s breast or been soothed to rest again in father s arms the prisoner is separated from her husband went on that monotonous voice how strange was separated from her husband strange she should be like the prisoner a shameful disgraced prisoner and dreaming she smiled smiled in the dock with a hundred opera glasses her fair pale face and a hundred naked eyes burning into her secrets but the smile woke her she had always smiled but now now it was a long time since she had by t the f smiled what was she smiling at then she woke to the knowledge of her surroundings and she shuddered in the dock the sweet face grew white and suddenly she burst out crying crying aloud poor child poor child who had meant to play through life and woke from her playing  here all alive and awake she was for the rest of that horrible day quivering and trembling and sobbing half child half woman as the trial wore on ever and again the crimson flushed into her cheek her eyes her head bent in a very agony of shame she heard horrible questions horrible answers she felt herself before these eyes and shrinking drawing her cloak round her with shaking hands she would try and hide her poor hot face but as the day wore on something of hope crept in warm about her heart if frank were here he would not let them talk so  frank her lover she heard again the passionate of their short she felt again his lips against hers she was back again in the golden days when the sun flush of love was over all her life and sun queen in those hours she had played with her happiness and the tremulous lips murmured if frank were here he would not let them hurt me if frank were here what a strange complicated ar by for murder she pleaded guilty guilty though her hands were clean with the generosity of a child she did a woman s deed with a man s heart she took her husband s guilt upon herself and cried it was i while yet the horror of his act was through her frame she had not counted the cost could not but if all the sum of those dreadful hours and days had been spread out before her with shining eyes she would have it and still have called out generously it was i but her heart was larger than her brain her brain failed her a little at the last she was dim confused frightened she forgot so much these men who were there to judge her noting the crouching weeping girl with golden hair eyes weak and shrinking thinking her y pronounced her innocent and sent her forth free free but what a freedom where was frank where was anybody who was there to take her in his strong arms let her hide her face upon his breast weep there until her shame had died away and the memory of her degradation was washed clean who indeed the man who had defended her who had been her lover who had been her friend came to her and he  he would not take her hand he had spoken to her of her boy and the cold by u the of of her heart ached with the sudden rush of her emotion as she cried out with outstretched arms my boy bring me my boy to press the child in her arms to feel the soft down of his cheek against hers to hear the dear from his lips to have his arms about her  this this would save her reason she felt her reason going felt her mind darkened the path before her no longer clear she was in a gloomy world groping helplessly for a warm human clasp of fellowship her friend answered her mother cry answered and left her then he brought her here here to this beautiful lonely wind sea island and left her to strain her eyes out into the sea that said nothing to her the sky was empty for her the flowers it seemed to her faded as she looked poor beauty poor light hearted then she met frank in the street and light flashed back to her and memory and understanding in a rush of emotion she saw him as a lover as husband as murderer she knew what he had done she knew too what she had done to save him frank the words rushed to her lips words of love of forgiveness of and he her ice cold on her heart he lay his dead love his living contempt and she who would have died for him seemed as if she died by him by frank v he killed her not physically	edith-wharton
hay upon the top this had a small open window and i was able to look down upon the front of the inn and also upon the road there i crouched and waited to see what would happen it was soon evident that i had not been mistaken when i had thought that this might be the quarters of some person of importance shortly after daybreak an english light arrived with a despatch and from the green flag etc then the place was in a turmoil officers continually riding up and away always the same name was upon their lips sir sir it was hard for me to lie there with a dry moustache and watch the great which were brought out by the landlord to these english officers but it amused me to look at their fresh coloured dean shaven careless faces and to wonder what they would think if they knew that so celebrated a person was lying so near to them and then as i lay and watched i saw a sight which filled me with surprise it is incredible the insolence of these english what do you suppose had done when he found that had him and that he could not move his army i might give you many you might say that he had raged that he had that he had brought his troops together and spoken to them about glory and the before leading them to one last battle no did none of these things but he sent a fleet ship to england to bring him a number of fox dogs and he with his officers settled himself down to chase the fox it is true what i tell you behind the lines of these mad englishmen made the fox chase three days in the week we had heard of it in the camp and now i was myself to see that it was true for along the road which i have described there came these very dogs thirty or forty of them white and brown each with its tail at the same angle like the of the old guard my faith but it was a pretty sight and behind and amidst them there rode three men with caps and red coats whom i understood to he the hunters after them came many the crime of the with of various kinds along the roads in and talking together and laughing they did not seem to be going above a trot and it appeared to me that it must indeed be a slow fox which they hoped to catch however it was their affair not and soon they had all passed my window and were out of sight i waited and i watched ready for any chance which might offer presently an officer in a blue uniform not unlike that of our flying came down the road  an elderly stout man he was with grey side whiskers he stopped and began to talk with an orderly officer of who waited outside the inn and it was then that i learned the advantage of the english which had been taught me i could hear and understand all that was said where is the meet said the officer and i thought that he was for his but the other answered him that it was near so i saw that it was a place of which he spoke you are late sir george said the orderly yes i had a court martial has sir cotton gone at this moment a window opened and a handsome young man in a very splendid uniform looked out of it said he these cursed papers keep me but i will be at your heels very good cotton i am late already so i will ride on you might order my groom to bring my said the young general at the window to the orderly below while the other went on down the road the green flag etc the orderly rode away to some and then in a few minutes there came a smart english groom with a in his hat leading by the bridle a horse  and oh my friends you have never known the perfection to which a horse can attain until you have seen a first english hunter he was superb tall broad strong and yet as graceful and as a deer coal black he was in and his neck and his shoulder and his quarters and his  how can i describe him all to you the sim shone upon him as on polished and he raised his hoofs in a little playful dance so lightly and prettily while he tossed his mane and with impatience never have i seen such a mixture of strength and beauty and grace i had often wondered how the english had managed to ride over the of the guards in the affair at but i wondered no longer when i saw the english horses there was a ring for at the door of the inn and the groom tied the horse there while he entered the house in an instant i had seen the chance which fate had brought to me were i in that saddle i should be better off than when i started even could not compare with this magnificent creature to think is to act with me in one instant i was down the ladder and at the door of the stable the next i was out and the bridle was in my hand i bounded into the saddle somebody the master or the man shouted wildly behind me what cared i for his shouts i touched the horse with my spurs and he bounded forward with such a spring that only a rider like myself could have sat him i gave him his head and let him go  it did not matter to me where so long the crime of the as we left this inn	edith-wharton

answered the same purpose at the office he dreaded a renewal of the conversations with his father that would certainly refer to the marriage and besides he wanted to seek once more for traces of his lost margaret had not entirely given up his to the english girl even since he returned to boston and he had placed a personal advertisement in two of the papers asking miss m e to communicate with the friend whom she had left so suddenly in new york on such and such a date and promising not to interfere with her in any way providing her circumstances were satisfactory to her he had also offered a reward to whoever would send him information of the present whereabouts of a young woman answering her description and had this announcement inserted not only in new york papers but in those their marriage bond of and philadelphia nothing had been heard from either of these efforts and the young man felt a wild longing to visit again the city where he had last seen his idol in the mad hope that the which had her might cast her up again at his feet he made his plans so that there was no time for his father to talk with him beyond a simple good bye arriving at new york he conferred again with the firm of he had formerly employed and assisted them in searching the various lines which they recommended a week was passed in this way a weary week without a trace of sunshine and the result was nothing whatever what mr sustained in the way of mental pain during that week the reader can only imagine his love for margaret rivers had grown with every hour since she left him his apprehensions for her safety doubled as time passed he even feared that in desperation she had committed suicide and among the he made was a careful inspection of the self destroyed in a dozen cities from lists sent to the by request when he returned to boston his belief that he would never see margaret again was he was actually giving up all hope life would be to him a dreary existence by love of woman a mere round of business cares of plain duties the other thing that troubled him now was the inevitable conflict with his father he had seen this parent hovering on the edge of the grave too recently not to dread the encounter but come it must there was no escape had had no private conversation with the their marriage bond u since he announced his intention of breaking the engagement but on the day of his return from new york mrs sent him a note asking for an interview it served at least as an escape from his father s tongue and when the evening arrived presented himself at the widow s residence was not present for which he was thankful during two hours he was subjected to mrs s ingenious arguments delivered with all her art and in her most agreeable manner she presented the case in a dozen lights in every one of which he seemed a wretch unfit for decent society if he carried out his scheme still he was not moved he replied to everything that he had made up his mind that he could not bring himself to the marriage he was very sorry for he would give anything if he could her pain but marry he would not there was nothing for mrs to do after this but to call on mr and him with the situation the anger of the father when he learned what she had to say knew no bounds when his son came home that night he turned upon him savagely and in a torrent of rage demanded his reasons for this conduct seemed by what he had endured and did not mind as much as he once would have done the that were into his ears he replied over and over that he did not love and that nothing would persuade him to wed her seeing that the mode of attack he was using had no effect edward s tone changed suddenly to a pleading one he said he had a terrible secret to reveal to his son one that made this marriage an absolute necessity for years he explained seeing the astonished look in his son s eyes i have been in financial their marriage difficulties i have prevented the truth being known but if my real condition was public to day i should be in the court miss is rich with an alliance between our families everything would be easy you are my only child is the sole heir of her father it would kill me to have my affairs dragged into the newspapers to refuse this marriage would therefore not merely destroy the happiness of a beautiful girl who has trusted you but would end the life of one who has no other hope to preserve a hitherto honored name the young man was astounded he had imagined while giving no special thought to the matter that his father was comfortably off in this world s goods certainly far beyond the line of poverty they had always lived well a snug sum had been paid into the concern to secure the when he mentioned these things he was told that the money put into the firm was borrowed on heavy interest and with this marriage in view as the only way in which the notes could be taken up it was not a very honorable transaction and he felt it to the quick but he could not reproach a father for what he had done however ill for his benefit he began to grow desperate one by one all the that had sustained his life had fallen away his determination not to marry grew weaker even before he was aware of the change	arthur-conan-doyle
of outrage against a social system under which such evils could exist and to prepare her for her of her sex she first threw down the to conventional opinion when she helped her sister to escape from her husband s roof in so doing she displayed those forces of character which were afterwards to inspire the the love of justice the hatred of oppression courage and above all a fund of common sense which amounted to genius the two sisters and blood opened a school at green which at first was successful about this time mary was introduced to dr johnson who seems to have had some appreciation of her extraordinary powers in blood married her uncertain lover and went with him to a few months later mary followed her there to nurse her in what proved to be her last illness after the death of her beloved friend she their friendship in her first novel  mary a fiction on her return to england she gave up her school and accepted the position of in the family of lord in ireland after holding this

german and s from the french besides writing some tales for children published as original stories from real life with illustrations by in s reflections on the french revolution written from the of a tory and a aroused g eat indignation among the of england its scorn of the common people and their rights its support of tradition merely as tradition outraged the spirit of justice and mercy which dwelt continually with mary she published a entitled of the rights of man in which she the of with more zeal perhaps than discretion but with a by mary wonderful passion for truth and charity liberty and advancement amid the of the the clear outlines of logic can here and there be traced referring to s reliance on precedent for authority she asks does recommend night as the time to a ray of light

epoch making books it is the prophecy of the nineteenth century by a woman who endured the t of the over her sex in her of the work to she sets forth its argument  for the rights of woman my main argument is built on this simple principle  that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man she will stop the progress of knowledge for truth must be common to all or it will be with respect to its influence on the general practice the book as a whole is an elaborate demonstration of this principle the author that no great improvement of society can be expected unless women are regarded by men not as made for their pleasure but as rational beings on whose nobility of character the welfare of the family  and through the family of the state  depends she the of s ideal of women as mere to the of men and proceeds to show that this ideal governing the education of girls has made them the inferior beings which men find them she as the mingling of the sexes in childhood more out of door life for and the training them to look upon marriage not as a means of support or as a dignity but as the highest expression of love and friendship she the necessity of this friendship which depends upon the intellectual of husband and wife she that intellectual companionship indeed is the chief as it is the lasting happiness of marriage it is difficult to believe that this reasonable and noble idea of woman s place in the family should have aroused the resentment of more and of the majority of the english reading public but like all books which mark a step in advance of prevailing custom and sentiment it had to undergo by the mob mary had uncovered the source of the of the century the source also of its its this was its contemptible view of women it is small wonder that she incurred the resentment of her generation in she went to paris to study the phenomena of the french revolution then in progress she afterwards published the first volume of a work entitled an historical and moral view of the origin by mary and progress of the french revolution during her stay in paris she entered upon the tragedy of her life which came to through her love for an american his desertion of her  my best friend and wife as he calls her in a business document  whatever it proved to the proved to those who knew the integrity of mary s character that he was not able to appreciate the of her love nor the purity of her nature  a purity dangerous perhaps to society through its rare and exquisite quality in she became the wife of william the author of political equality  in his way also an who placed the individual before society the other of the pair was in this union mary knew the first serenity of her short troubled life but it was not to be of long duration she died in the year of her marriage ten days after the birth of the daughter who was to become the wife of she was more guided by in her books than in her life which was ruled by her

mr ware i am a concert singer now and it pays me i am very pleased with your success princess but anne she flashed a rather annoyed look at him you are scarcely so as i thought mr ware she said coldly no say nothing i quite understand let us talk of anne i will tell you her history she re lighted her which had gone out and continued her father was a and a wanderer he lived mostly on the continent  for choice anne s mother  here the princess paused and then went on with an obvious effort  i know nothing of anne s mother mr ware she died when anne was a child mr brought up his daughter in a way was his name really so anne told me i had no reason to think that it was otherwise he was a gentleman of good family but an outcast from his people by reason of his reckless folly i also am an outcast said she pleasantly but merely because i am strong minded i am not foolish a coin of edward the fact is said steel easily i have changed my opinion mr ware and i think miss is innocent the man who killed miss is called and who is and why did he kill her i don t know who is replied steel i am trying to find out i am not quite certain why he killed her but i am beginning to suspect that it was on account of this inherited money i told you that princess he added turning to the yes mr steel and i said then i say now i do not agree if you would be more explicit said ware feeling helpless steel took no notice of him for the moment then if it s not the money i don t know what the motive can be he turned to ware see here sir this he may be lived with the mother of s  he was her the boy told him about the money coming to miss afterwards the lad had a summons given him to serve on offered to take it and did so he removed his effects from mrs s house  she s the mother of the lad  and went down to you know what happened there now if he didn t kill miss on account of the money why did he ask the office boy about the matter shook his head i can t say he said no more than i can explain why miss helped him to escape well  steel scratched his chin  i have an idea about that but you must not be offended if i speak plainly mr ware i shall be offended if you speak evil of my friend miss this was from the princess who raised princess herself up with her eyes flashing angrily i will not have it she said then am i to say nothing asked steel nothing against miss put in you are both rather difficult to deal with remarked steel with a shrug however fu explain and you can draw your own it seems from what mrs said that mr was mostly out all night and in all day also he was frequently absent for a long time he likewise took much interest in society newspapers and in the movements of the aristocracy he also wore on his chain an ornament  a red cross in fact what cried with a start and he noted that the princess started likewise and that her face grew pale he wore a red cross repeated steel on his watch chain mrs had been in the service of the late lady when the diamonds of that lady were stolen she remembered that a red cross had been found in the safe whence the jewels were taken was amused at this he said that the cross was the emblem of a charitable society from which he received a weekly sum well  he hesitated and looked at his listeners  that clue came to an end i lost sight of i then went to look for the red cross  the i mean what has the to do with asked ware angrily if you remember sir i told you that was the man who served the summons on mr and who as i believed killed miss he afterwards fled with miss and went on board the is not that the case sir so far as i can judge it is muttered reluctantly ii a coin of edward vii well then went on steel triumphantly while the princess  as observed  listened intently i looked after that i could not find her but i am looking for her now that is why i am in the country i came up this morning from deal and i go back there to morrow i find sir that this puts in at various places every now and then most do yes sir but while most are at anchor in a place does a invariably occur no sir wait for had sprung to his feet lady s place was on the her diamonds were stolen at the time this was at anchor in the bay a red cross was found in the safe the boat is called by that name several times i find that when the has been at a certain place a has occurred this man wears a red cross on his watch chain now sir i believe that he is one of a gang of  that the cross is a sign this explains his interest in the society papers he wants to find out where the best is to be found and but what has all this to do with my friend anne cried the princess steel shrugged his shoulders i say nothing he replied you can draw your own do you mean to say that miss	mark-twain
had caught the new york the other day his plans would the begins have i d never have married that man i d have the moment he spoke to me and if had got a book out of my trip to europe at all it would have been a series of papers on some such topic as the abroad or how to be happy though single no more shall i take the part he me to in this romance unless he count from the scene entirely and me with a different style of hero from his professor the of whom by the way as i happen to know is already married and has two children i went to school with his wife and i know just how much of a hero he is and so they went to and s novel opened a rebellious heroine his description of the was perfect his of the incidents of the could not be improved upon in any way they were absolutely true to the life but his account of what said and did and thought while on the was not at all  it was imagination of the wildest kind for she said did and thought nothing of the sort did his best but his heroine was and the poor fellow did not know that he was writing for he verily believed that he heard and saw all that he attributed to her exactly as he put it down so the story began well and for a time was quite happy at the end of a week however he had a fearful set the begins back count was ready to be presented to according to the plan but there the broke down s heroine took a new and entirely unexpected tack iv a chapter from with notes good bye proud world i m going home thou art not my friend and fm not thine  i think the reader will possibly gain a better idea of what happened at the dance at which count was to have been presented to miss if i forego the pleasure of writing this chapter myself and produce instead the chapter of s ill fated book which was to have dealt with that most interesting incident having all hope of ever getting that a chapter from with notes particular story into shape without a change of heroine and being unwilling to go to that extreme mr has very kindly placed his manuscript at my disposal use it as you will my dear fellow he said when him for it i can t do anything with it myself an it is merely occupying space in my for which i can find better use it may need a certain amount of  in fact it is sure to for it is long and thanks to the persistent failure of miss to do as i thought she would may frequently seem for your own sake it for the readers of your book won t believe that you are telling a true story anyhow they will say that you wrote this chapter and attributed it to a rebellious heroine me and you will find yourself held responsible for its i have inserted a few notes here and there which will give you an idea of what i suffered as i wrote on and found her growing daily less and less with occasionally an indication of the point of between her actual behavior and that which i expected of her to a fellow workman in literary fields this chapter is of pathetic interest though it may not so appear to the reader who knows little of the difficulties of i can hardly read it myself without a feeling of most intense pity for poor i can imagine the sleepless nights which followed the of his hopes as to what his story might be by the attitude of the young woman he had hon a chapter from with notes so highly by selecting her for his heroine i can almost feel the bitter sense of disappointment which must have burned to the very depths of his soul when he finally realized how completely were all his plans and i cannot forego calling attention to the constancy to his creed of in sacrificing his opportunity rather than his principles as shown by his resolute determination not to force miss to do his bidding even though it required merely the dipping of his pen into the ink and the resolution to do so i cannot blame her however to the right to a creed miss too it must be admitted was entitled to have views as to how she ought to behave under given a rebellious heroine and if she found her notions running counter to his it was only proper that she should act according to the of her own heart or mind or whatever else it may be that a woman reasons with rather than according to his wishes as to all questions of this kind however as between the two the reader must judge and one document in evidence is s chapter which ran in this wise a meeting stop hearty and in a moment calm the question answer  is this then my fate f  s as the of the new york papers had invitations for the ball were issued on the th it is not surprising that the a chapter from with notes in this instance should be guilty of

while one crept up slower than the rest and i with my foot thrust myself in good time somewhat out from the wall and crying aloud margaret did grip with all my soul the wood work of the sail and that moment was swimming in the air well done i well done v motion i felt little but the stars seemed to go round the sky and then the grass came up t me nearer and nearer and when the grass was quite close i was sent rolling along it as if hurled from a and got up breathless and every point and tie about me broken i rose but fell down again in agony i had but one leg i could stand on eh i dear i his leg is broke ray boy s leg is broke and e en as i lay i heard a sound like thunder it was the running up the stairs the crazy old mill shook under them they must have found i had not fallen into their bloody trap and running to despatch me margaret i felt no fear for now i had no hope i could neither run nor hide so wild the place so bright the moon i struggled up all agony and revenge more uke some wounded wild beast than your leaning on my sword round and swift as lightning or vengeance i heaped a great pile of their hay and wood at the mill door then drove my dagger into a barrel of their spirits and flung it on then out with my and lighted the pile this will bring true men round my dead body said i i cried think you i ll die alone reckless i and at each word on went a barrel pierced but oh margaret the fire fed by the spirits surprised me it shot up and my very hair it went roaring up the side of the mill swift as falls the lightning and i and laughed in my torture and despair and pierced more barrels and the very tar barrels and flung them on the fire roared like a lion for its prey and voices answered it inside from the top of the mill and the feet came thundering down and i stood as near that awful fire as i could with uplifted sword to and be slain the bolt was drawn a tar barrel caught fire the door was opened what followed not the men came out but the fire rushed in at them like a living death and the first i thought to fight with was blackened and on the floor like a one yell and dumb for ever the feet ran up again but fewer i heard them hack with their swords a little way up at the mill s wooden sides but they had no time to their way out the fire and were at their heels and the smoke burst out at every and blue in the moonlight through each i back with pain and fury there were white faces up at my window they saw me they cursed me i cursed them back and shook my naked sword the and the hearth come down the road i came i cried but ye must one by one and as ye come ye die upon my sword some cursed at that but others for i had them all at deadly and doubtless with my smoke face and rage i looked a demon and now there was a steady roar inside the the flame was going up it as from furnace up its chimney the mill caught fire fire through it tongues of flame darted through each and shot sparks and fiery into the night one of the leaped on to the sail as i had done in his hurry he missed his grasp and fell at my feet and bounded from the hard like a ball and never spoke nor moved again and the rest screamed like women and with their despair came back to me both for them and hope of life for myself and the fire through the mill in and shot forth showers of great flat sparks like of fiery snow and the sails caught fire one after another and i became a man again and staggered away terror stricken leaning on my sword from the sight of my revenge and with great bodily pain crawled back to the road and dear margaret the trees were all now like of golden and lace fine in the red oh i most beautiful i and a poor wretch got entangled in the burning sails and whirled round screaming and lost hold at the wrong time and hurled like stone from high into the air then a dull it was his striking the earth the next moment there was a loud crash the mill fell in on its and a million great sparks flew up and the sails fell over the burning wreck and at that a million more sparks flew up and the ground was strewn with burning wood and men i prayed god forgive me and kneeling with my back to that fiery i saw lights on the road a welcome sight it was a company coming towards me and scarce two off i towards them ere i had gone far i heard a swift step behind me i turned one had escaped how escaped who can divine his sword shone in the moonlight i feared him the ghosts of all those dead sat on that glittering i put my other foot to the ground the anguish and fled tow the moaning with pain and shouting for aid but what could i do he gained on me me turn and fight had taught me sword play in sport i wheeled our swords his clothes they all i cut swiftly upward with hand and his bleeding at the wrist and his sword fell it on the ground	jane-austen
the lease however it stands to reason that it s a fraud it comes from a man who is all fraud but thank god i am myself again he started up erect as a dart i ll have him off my lands i ll drag him out of the is of the earth him and all his with this and other threats of the same character he marched out of the room striking the floor hard with his stick as he went and left amazed and walter aghast at his fury chapter xiii the serpent let loose walter was so distressed at this outburst and the prospect of actual between his father and his sweetheart s father that pitied him and after thinking a little said she would stop it for the present she then sat down and in five minutes the pen of a female letter writer produced an composition impossible to resist she for her apparent but would be candid and confide the whole truth to mr bell then she told him that colonel had only just been saved from death by a miracle and a was expected in case of any great excitement or irritation such as a doubtful with a gentleman he disliked would certainly cause the proposed was or various reasons most distressing to his son and successor walter and would mr bell be so very kind as to put the question off as long as possible by any means he thought proper walter was grateful and said what a comfort to have a lady on one s side i would rather have a gentleman on mine said laughing mr bell wrote a discreet reply he would wait till the  six weeks delay  and then write to the colonel his visit this he did and promised to look up cases meantime but these two not only baffled their chief they also him to the full they never mentioned the name of and they kept out of sight in spite of his and in a word they made the colonel s life so smooth that he thought he was going to have his own way in everything and he improved in health and spirits for you know it is an old saying always get your own way and you ll never die in a pet and then what was still a tottering situation was kept on its legs by the sweet character and gentle temper of mary we have already mentioned that she was superior to most women in the habit of close attention to whatever she undertook this was the real key to her facility in languages history music drawing and as by a perilous secret her professor called female the creature s limbs were in secret steel she could go thirty feet up a slack rope hand over hand with wonderful ease and grace and hang by one hand for ten minutes to kiss the other to her friends so the very day she was surprised into to marry walter secretly she sat down to the marriage service and learned it all by heart directly and understood most of it by this means she realized that now she had another man to obey as well as her father so now when walter pressed her for secret meetings she said oh yes if you insist she even remarked that she concluded meetings were the natural consequence of a marriage she used to meet her husband in the day when she could and often for five minutes under the moon and she even promised to spend two or three days with him at the lakes if a safe opportunity should occur but for that she that mr hope must be absent walter asked her why she was more afraid of mr hope than of her father her eyes seemed to look inward dimly and at first she said she didn t know but after pondering the matter a little she said because he watches me more closely than papa and that is because  you won t tell anybody no not a soul upon your honor not a soul dearest upon my honor well then because he loves me more oh come said walter but mary would neither resign her opinion nor pursue a subject which puzzled and grieved her we have now indicated the peaceful tenor of things in for a period of some months wo shall have to show by and by that elements of discord were under the surface but at present we must leave and deal very briefly with another of events beginning years ago and running to a date three months at least ahead of colonel s recovery the reader will have no reason to regret this apparent interruption our tale hitherto has been rather but it is in narrative as it is in nature when two streams unite their forces the current

but his spirits revived at where he was cheered by the conversation of other their name was but as he never met one of them again except ben all those are happily and the reader need not fear an introduction to them unless he should find himself in some dark street or or his home some dark and windy night as for ben he was from the north country imprisoned for conspiracy and in an attack upon

for all of us and our conversation turned mainly upon the little visitors i ll tell you what you ought to dr said mrs drew you should found an orphan asylum amusing children is evidently your i think you are never quite happy unless you have them near you held a blue eyed boy in her lap at the moment and was engaged in trying to make a part in his very thin curly hair yes she replied i do love them it always makes me sad when i have to send them home will be a splendid mother interposed mr drew and i felt at the instant that he had put his foot in it the girl leaned toward us as we sat in the group watching her and her sweet face lit up with a radiance wonderful to behold oh i hope so she said softly clasping her hands together what must it be to feel that one of these creatures is your own your very own yes mr drew it is what i long for what i dream of at night i have seen it in visions that little the was too great close against my heart touching my face with its velvet fingers breathing upon my neck i felt my cheeks and was ashamed at the sensation in the presence of such purity what right had a mistaken education to manifest its in the movements of my blood i glanced at the others was smiling upon his daughter as if he fully approved of what she said mrs drew s hand had stolen across that of her husband to warn him not to pursue the subject farther with a man s lack of tact however he tried to set things right and made matters worse it will be a long time before you can think of marriage he suggested straightened up in her chair and the child in her lap that he was being temporarily neglected pulled at the tiny brush she had been using and proceeded to the locks she had straightened out marriage she repeated i do not think i shall ever marry the risk is too great to run i glanced at again and on his face was the same smile of approval that same contented look that always it whenever his daughter was near turned again to her charge and resumed her attentions while mrs drew with the tact that her husband did not possess began speaking of matters outside the house it had turned out after mrs s that george was now a very prosperous man his experiments had resulted in producing the most popular powder on the market and he owned out of considerably the largest share of the stock in the company for which he had formerly worked during the lifetime of his wife this fact had been kept secret but later the true state of affairs was made public in his generosity he had allowed mr drew to purchase several shares at a rate when the capital was being increased as a token of his esteem for that gentleman and his wife it was his intention to retire from active labor soon and make a long tour abroad with his daughter i am rich enough he said in reply to some remark that was made i little thought when i entered the works at that i should be able to own most of the concern within a quarter century the business has got beyond the possibility of failure my goods are sold in every hamlet of the country and are even being in large quantities and yet he added with a touch of pathos in his voice my life has been a failure after all the babies had now been to their several homes and miss was sitting with the rest of us listening to the conversation her face clouded as she heard these words don t say that father she protested i must say it he replied putting his arm around the young form all the best of my youth was spent in mental darkness there is something wrong with our marriage system the women of to day have an idea that is a mere in which all the pleasure and none of the are to be theirs i sometimes think it is time the entire institution was that we returned to a more natural state of living public the risk was too great opinion ties many a couple together through weary years when the best interests of both demand a separation there are exceptions of course like you rs mr drew but i question if they are not in a great what can a man like me for the suffering i during the first five years of my marriage i looked at uneasy that she should hear this debate but she seemed so much older than formerly so much wiser that my fears were you ought to remember replied mrs drew that your wife acknowledged her errors and bitterly repented of them it is unfair to matrimony on account of one unfortunate experience besides there is no use in an institution without which the world would soon come to an end i had never heard this lady speak so earnestly she appeared as if defending her sex in a body from the of all time if that happened if the world came to an end retorted good the only harm that would result so far as i can see would be a falling off in the sale of my powder but you need have no fear that the human race is going to die out on account of any change in the ideas regarding marriage before a great many years my dear mrs drew there will be such a of the of woman that each one will select the father of her children and dispense with his society whenever she finds it agreeable to do so	arthur-conan-doyle

of your argument last night she was certainly candid but the frank way in which she spoke surprised him a little yes and i have been friends from childhood he said he has known you for a long time also i believe quite long eight or nine years ah before his marriage then he did not think it very good to come to the point so soon when the words were out of his mouth but he had the joint in her and struck at it blindly she met him without apparent yes it was some months previous i expected at that time to be a wife soon myself probably he told you of my my misfortune her voice faltered as she uttered the words and he nodded a reply to the question she paused a moment and then said i need not ask you if you left mr well he was quite so and happy he had not anticipated the was it the friend or the jealous mistress who asked it i can hardly say yes to that he replied does not seem to me as bright as he used to be i was separated from him for several years and on meeting him again i find a great change and one that i do not like he has lost much of his old cheerfulness his head is full of and ideas like those of mr when love has fled ill whom i met here last night they may or may not be correct but i think they are bad for a man of his temperament they weigh constantly on his mind his spirits have lost their he sees less than he ought of the of the earth to his surprise this statement only brought a touch of sunshine into her face he knows as i do she said that a great is coming and that it is a time for those who wish to help it onward to adopt a serious mien standing as he does to day on ground which must so soon echo with the tread of an arisen people perhaps be with their best blood he does well to personal pleasure he smiled at her earnestness as we can never agree on that subject said he perhaps it would be as well to talk about something else i am glad to say however that our friend in his desire to save the down trodden of a does not forget the more important business of his journey he is using all efforts to secure the that he wants for his invention perhaps when he has made a million or two he will develop into an like the rest of us you do not know him cried miss with enthusiasm it is only the hope of gaining a fortune that he can use in our cause that spurs him on think there is no doubt that when he is in possession of his magnificent income he will devote it all to hastening the of and the of throughout the world v s smile faded all he repeated every dollar for and nothing for wife and children husband s her self possession gave way in a moment and tht nails of her white hands buried themselves in the flesh children she gasped and in a breath he knew that he had revealed a secret which he had not intended to do why not children as well as wife he asked pretending not to understand perhaps you are one of those who believe that a man s children should not inherit his goods but you would hardly claim that the father who is responsible for their existence ought to leave them to starve while they are young and helpless i can only think you do not mean to be taken literally when you say that mr should give all of his coming fortune t advance his theories we ask no one to neglect making proper provision for his relations she stammered he has a a child then thought of and his heart grew very hard and cold i said children he replied i know i understood you but sometimes people use the she was hoping against hope and the agony of the doubt was visible in every he thought it best to tell her everything now he had gone so far there are two the elder seven the younger three if i had not supposed you knew you may be sure i should not have alluded to the subject a criminal on the rack could hardly have suffered more than she did at that moment and she felt compelled to bear the pain with the fortitude of a martyr when love has mr never spoke to me of of such things she slowly i knew he was married and i supposed i understood i mean i thought very likely there was a child i did not know there was another and only three years old you say so he told me said fearing lest the next question would be whether he had himself seen them you have never met mrs i believe she shook her head making the greatest effort to appear calm there was no reason why i should mr and i are engaged in a social we publish a magazine together his private affairs or mine are never alluded to in our conversations all that i ever knew of his marriage is that it was sudden and unfortunate her voice had regained most of its natural strength and she looked more like herself again how unfortunate in what respect he asked determined to the matter as far as she would permit i do not think i ought to any more she responded you are his friend and if he has not chosen to tell you anything i should be at least as he has told me a good deal said i know he does not consider her	arthur-conan-doyle

afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him  give admirable material for class discussion the first should appeal to the children who must be made to understand that to jim the man

flesh and blood and it shows also by excellent contrast how the was to the of the inn for the second chapter the would for most classes include such words as the expressions which be made clear in would include cleared the of his showed a clean pair of the tap stake my wig open a vein this chapter has a number of delicate touches which should be brought to the notice of the class talks on teaching literature as the lump in tlie throat of black dog while he waited for tlie in moral terror his clever excuse for having the door left apparently that ho might be sure jim was not listening but in reality that he might have a way of escape in case of danger the picture of the gallows in the the s of bones and jim are added to in the chapter and that of the doctor made more clear the touch by which the boy is made to feel compassion for the when bones turns so ghastly at the sight of black dog is one which should not be to  begins to develop and the youthful reader must be unusually if he does not upon the past of bones and upon the relation of the with black dog it is not necessary to go on with this sort of analysis for the method am must be that of most teachers k the points mentioned seem to some over minute i can only say that since the aim is to teach children how to handle fiction the task of training them to be careful in their reading is of the first importance there is no risk of making them or too observant this is moreover the study of a novel and it should be more careful than reading is supposed to be it is morally certain that any child will fall below the standard bet and it is therefore necessary to have the standard as high aa it be without or the children tbe study of the novel when the book been gone through in way comes the important question of dealing with it as a whole it would hardly be wise to ask directly what they think of a book as a complete work and yet that is the thing at which the teacher wishes to arrive the way has been prepared by the study of character and the discussion of incident in the end the subject of character as it is from the beginning of the tale to the close may easily lead the way to making up some estimate of the book as a first do the persons in the romance act second do the incidents follow along so that they seem really to have happened these questions will at first have a tendency to young readers who are likely to accept anything in a romance as if it were true and to hare no judgment beyond the matter whether the book does or does not interest them it is not to be expected that they will go very deep or be very broad in their dealing with such points in the case of a first novel but they can ma ke a beginning they cannot in the book in question go far in what is the natural third question concerning a book as a whole does it show clearly and truly the development of character under the circumstances of the jim is at the end of the book older and more manly than at the start as shown for instance by his refusal to break his word to silver when the doctor talks with him over the and him to come away with talks on teaching literature him with the other

before he could collect his wits a message came that he was wanted by jove it s george he said and hurried out of the room mrs overheard the name i suppose hb friend is called george mrs receives is thought and frowned her recollections of that name were not pleasant however she thought no more about the matter but mr for his to the it is so sweet of mrs to play it i beg beg pardon putting away his envelope and looking up with a dreamy eye i was a new i hope to make my fortune out of it madame smiled she had heard that prophecy before but poor s inventions had never succeeded in getting him the house in park lane he was always dreaming about but she patted his shoulder and then sailed across to miss bull the music doesn t please you miss bull she said in rather an tone it s very nice the old maid the cards but i have heard the before you may not have the chance of hearing it again said madame miss bull shrugged her shoulders to signify that it did not matter i suppose that means mrs is about to leave us she said there may be changes in the soon miss bull it s a world of change replied miss bull in her sharp voice was that a heart pointed a fat finger to the card in question and miss bull muttered something about her getting worse madame knew that this was just done to annoy her as miss bull s sight was excellent to revenge herself she took away go and tell the servants to send up the and she said sharply rose heavily she was a huge girl of twenty years of age and apparently very stupid the yellow why sharp little miss bull who loved no one had taken to her no one knew but the two were inseparable seeing this madame usually kept hard at work in other quarters so as to part her from the old maid but with the of an and was very much of that the girl managed to see a great deal of her one friend madame had an idea of the reason for this but at the present moment did not think it was necessary to interfere she was quite capable of crushing miss bull when the need arose meantime she her temper by sending away the girl departed with a and an angry look at her aunt but miss bull never raised her eyes though she was well aware of what was going on madame was not to be beaten i tell you what dear miss bull she said smiling graciously since you have broken through our rule and have produced the cards you shall tell all our fortunes yours asked miss bull looking up for the first time madame shook her head i know mine tell mr if his invention will succeed or perhaps mr i am at miss bull s service said the polite old gentleman bowing miss bull swept the cards into a heap fm quite willing she said in a voice almost pleasant for her anything to oblige dear madame mrs smiled still more graciously and sailed away to send mr to the cards but she wondered inwardly why miss bull had given way so suddenly there was some reason for it as miss bull never did anything without a reason but mrs kept her own counsel and still continued to smile she had quite made up her mind how to act ladies and gentlemen she said standing in mrs receives the middle of the drawing room we must to night at ten i have some business to attend to so i request you will all retire at that hour in the mean time miss bull has kindly consented to tell your fortunes it was extraordinary to see how those withered old people crowded round the table their several had long since been settled so what they could expect the cards to tell them save that they would one and all die soon it is difficult to say yet so is the wish to know the future in the human breast that they were as eager as youth to hear what would befall them and miss bull wholly unmoved by their excitement dealt the cards with the air of a madame meantime retired to her throne and saw that the servants arranged the tray properly she had a gigantic chair which was called her throne and here she received strangers in quite a majestic way it was a sort of lady reception on a small scale as mr assured her and as he had been to house in hid youth he knew what he was talking about knowing his manners and being greedy of compliments mrs always tried to make him say that she resembled lady but this mt refused to do not that mrs was bad looking she had a fresh colored face bright black eyes and plenty of white hair like spun silk her figure was stout but she yet retained a certain which showed that she must have been a handsome woman in her youth her manners were but she showed a stern face toward and did not treat the girl so kindly as she might have done as a rule she had great but sometimes gave way to of passion which were really but mar the yellow alone had been witness of these and mrs passed for a dear gentle old lady mr is to be married announced mrs leaving the the card table how extraordinary so extraordinary that it can t possibly be true said mr unless madame will accept me he added bowing i should miss bull replied madame very sweetly but with a note in her voice she might as well have thought to rouse the dead for miss bull paid not the attention	mark-twain

much as the most degraded of our live for spirits besides these there are many who are not obliged to have recourse to selling and to get along but who such things as the education of their children and flowers for their wives heads and who from having eaten meat twice daily eat it only once or substitute for it a purely vegetable diet which must contain much honey and sugar to relieve the heat

right and left and part with all they can pledge for anything every year from fresh and paying back a of the old debts till they can borrow no longer and drop into the class among these are seen the ragged wretches who to former acquaintances and beg from them the ashes of their pipes even drinking these with hot water to satisfy the craving the rich smoke what is known as the import from india which they compare to a coal fire and the native to a wood one but the manufacture of the latter is improving rapidly and as it is used to mix with the indian a generation is growing up in the upper

content themselves with a smoke of ashes only and the lowest of all of the have to satisfy themselves with eating or drinking the ashes of the third burning there is a class which can afford to buy the pure but which finds that it does not satisfy the craving but this is in a far larger one of old and rich of one s weight per day who smoke not even the very best prepared indian for their craving needs far stronger but ashes of the first degree such men give the prepared extract weight for weight value for value for the ashes and contract with shops to be supplied with all their ashes of the

active principle of not being consumed in the smoke owing to its lack of the eating of the ashes water tobacco which contain seven per cent and upwards of it has a very serious effect the fact that is

furious gestures unexpectedly the male shadow seized the female by the throat and swung her like a feather to and fro the struggling figures out of the radiance and heard a faint cry the silent house thinking that something was wrong he rushed up the steps and rang the bell violently almost before the sound died away the light in the room was extinguished and he could see nothing more again and again he rang but without attention so finally left the house and went in search of the policeman to his experience at the entrance of square he ran against a man whom he recognised in the clear moonlight to his surprise he beheld mark chapter iii an unsatisfactory explanation mr cried the man is it you who else should it be replied bending forward to see who had him who else should it be mr but i thought  i thought said the unable to conceal his surprise that is i fancied you were indoors your fancy was wrong you see i am not indoors then who is in your house shrugged his shoulders no one so far as i know you are mistaken sir there was a light in your room and i saw the shadows of a man and a woman struggling together thrown on the blind people in my house said laying a shaking hand on the arm of impossible i tell you it is so come then and we will look for them said in a tremulous voice but they have gone by this time the silent house ai gone i yes said rapidly i rang the bell as i fancied there was some fatal quarrel going on within at once the light was put out and as i could attract no one to the door i suppose the man and woman must have fled for a moment or so said nothing but his grip on s arm relaxed and he moved forward a few steps you must be mistaken mr said he in altered tones there can be no person in my house i locked the door before i went out and i have been absent at least two hours then i must be mad or dreaming i retorted with heat we can soon prove if you are either of the two sir come with me and examine the house for yourself pardon me said drawing back it is none of my business but i warn you mr that others are more curious than i am several times people have been known to be in your house while you were absent and your mode of life and strange does not commend itself to the in this neighbourhood if you persist in giving rise to gossip and scandal some may bring the police on the scene the police echoed the old man now greatly alarmed as would appear from his shaking voice no no that will never do my house is my castle i the police dare not break into it i am a the silent house peaceful and very unfortunate gentleman who wishes to live quietly all this talk of people being in my house is nonsense yet you seemed afraid when i told you of the shadows said afraid i i am afraid of nothing not even of those who are after you hinted recalling the conversation of the previous occasion ber in gave a kind of shriek and stepped back a pace as though to place himself on his guard what  what do you know about such  such things he panted only so much as you hinted at when i last saw you yes yes i i was not myself on that night the wine was in and the wit was out the truth also it would seem said judging by your agitation then and now i am an unfortunate gentleman if you will excuse me sir i shall leave you said it seems to be my fate to hold midnight conversations with you in the cold but i think this one had better be cut short one moment mr exclaimed you have been good enough to place me on my guard as to the talk my quiet course of life is causing pray add to your kindness by coming with me to my house and exploring it from to you the silent house will then see that there are no grounds for scandal and that the shadows you fancy you saw on the blind are not those of real people they can t be those of ghosts at all events replied as i never heard to my knowledge that spirits could cast shadows well come and see for yourself that the house is empty warmly as this invitation was given had some scruples about accepting it to explore an almost mansion with a complete stranger  and one with an ill reputation  at the midnight hour is not an enterprise to be by any man however bold he may be still had ample courage and more curiosity for the adventure as the chance of it stirred up that desire for romance which belongs peculiarly to youth also he was anxious to satisfy himself concerning the blind shadows and curious to learn why inhabited so dismal and mysterious a mansion add to these reasons a keen pleasure in by the occurrence of the unexpected and you will guess that ended by accepting the strange invitation of being now fully committed to the adventure he went forward with cool courage and an observant eye to spy out if possible the secret upon which these mysteries as on the former occasion his guest into the sitting room and here as previously a dainty supper was spread turned up the silent house the lamp light and waved his hand round the furnished

so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort and while she closed with a happy flourish he a then he out and saw just starting up the outside that led to the back rooms on the second floor were handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling they raged around like a hail storm and before aunt could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue six or seven had taken personal effect and tom was over the fence and gone there was a gate but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it his soul was at peace now that he had settled with for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble tom skirted the block and came round into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunt s he presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment and hastened toward the public square of the village where two military companies of boys had met for conflict according to previous appointment tom was general of one of these armies joe a bosom friend general of the other these two great did not condescend to fight in person  that being better suited to the still smaller  but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through de camp tom s army won a great victory after a long and hard fought battle then the dead were counted prisoners exchanged the terms of the next agreed upon and the day for the necessary battle appointed after which the armies fell into line and marched away and tom turned homeward alone as he was passing by the house where lived he saw a new girl in the garden  a lovely little blue eyed creature with yellow hair into two long tails white summer frock and embroidered the fresh crowned hero fell without firing a shot a certain vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind he had thought he loved her to distraction he had regarded his passion as adoration and behold it was only a poor little partiality he had been months winning her she had confessed hardly a week ago he had been the happiest and the boy in the world only seven short days and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done he worshipped this new angel with eye till he saw that she had discovered him then he pretended he did not know she was present and began to show off in all sorts of absurd boyish ways in order to win her admiration he kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time but by and by while he was in the midst of some dangerous performances he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was her way toward the house tom came up to the fence and leaned on it and hoping she would yet awhile longer she halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door tom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold but his face lit up right away for she tossed a over the fence a moment before she disappeared the boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it oh his nose with his head far back and as he moved from side to side in his efforts he edged nearer and nearer toward the finally bare foot rested upon it his toes closed upon it and he away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner but only for a minute  only while he could button the flower inside his jacket next his heart  or next his stomach possibly for he was not much posted in and not anyway he returned now and hung about the fence till nightfall showing off as before but the girl never exhibited herself again though tom comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some window meantime and been aware of his attentions finally he strode home reluctantly with his poor head full of visions all through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered what had got into the child he took a good scolding about and did not seem to mind it in the least he tried to steal sugar under his aunt s very nose and got his for it he said aunt you don t when he takes it well don t torment a body the way you do you d be always into that sugar if i warn t watching you presently she stepped into the kitchen and happy in his reached for the sugar bowl  a sort of over tom which was but s fingers slipped the bowl dropped and broke tom was in in such that he even controlled his tongue and was silent he said to himself that he would not speak a word even when his aunt came in but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief and then he would tell and there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet

call reckless and impulsive they must give up society for you may be quite sure that they will meet with the cold shoulder wherever they go you have certainly shown it to lady francis he said bitterly for the reason i have told you as for your sentimental rubbish about her ill treatment from her husband she cannot have suffered so very dreadfully as she has always had count de to console her thank you you have said quite enough i am sorry i attempted to your sympathy and i am doubly sorry that i men by the fate op you to lady francis i don t know what i shall say to hen you have placed me in a very awkward position you have placed yourself in one she said why not leave at once you are only being made a tool of and you had better let the e sort itself as best it may felt terribly perplexed and he could scarcely help feeling that there was a certain amount of truth  a certain amount of worldly wisdom  in what his sister had said of course did not care for him and never would had warned him against her and it was very foolish of him to indulge a wild dream which could never be anything but a wild dream he was perfectly convinced of her innocence with respect to de but evidently it was difficult to get others to share his and why should they believe that she was innocent when she allowed the man to come and stay in the hotel with her in defiance not only of her husband s wishes but also of all the laws of society and good taste his sister s words had been very severe and but he almost felt as if he must agree with her and this feeling added to his annoyance and depression what could he say to the poor little woman who was waiting for him to her from her difficulties how could he possibly explain to her that his sister had refused to by f a make her acquaintance when he had told her that she might count upon her assistance and sympathy he walked out of the house in a furious frame of mind he was angry with his sister and still more so with himself for being influenced by what she had said he went straight to his with lady francis and when she caught sight of him she started up and came forward with outstretched hands at once his doubts disappeared it only needed one look from her pleading brown eyes for all his old confidence and to be restored how kind you are said with gratitude beaming in her face have you been all this time with your sister when am i to see her then felt extremely uncomfortable and looked down and kicked about the gravel unable to answer the questions which were put to him what did your sister say pursued did you explain everything to her yes i explained everything he said awkwardly but not so well as i can explain it she continued and then am sure i shall like your sister  that is to say if she is like you she is not like me he said she is altogether different never mind she said brightly i shall like her all the same by o the fate of i am afraid he began yes what are you afraid of she asked you see my sister is going away very shortly in fact she may leave any day he answered oh i am so sorry she said simply yes he continued desperately and of course as her stay here is going to be so very short she thinks  i mean she fears well go on said calmly she fears that she could not be of much assistance to you but i myself am not going to stay long she said but it will be very kind of her to let me see something of her before she leaves it will silence the evil tongues she feels that it will be scarcely worth while to make your acquaintance said with a final violent kick at the gravel i understand said in altogether a different voice and the light went out of her face i can assure you said but stopped him you need say no more she said your sister refuses to know me i she is right then there was an awkward silence could find no excuses ready and was inwardly very indignant at last she managed to subdue her emotion sufficiently to say to him by f c i must thank you for the effort you have made on my behalf you have been very kind and whatever happens to me i will never forget your still found nothing to say and scarcely before he had realized it had turned from him and was hastily running toward the hotel by chapter vii by so so far away i never think but to regret i know too much the hush and silence had fallen over the outer world beyond and about the great hotel and something of its hush and mystery too in the deserted and public rooms of the building itself perhaps one or two of its inmates  so strangely thrown together  would have given almost every earthly possession for the

woman whose rank in life was not equal to his own  the daughter of some music master or i believe  i am not sure which this offended his family who would never take the smallest notice of him nor of his widow and children after his death will you believe it is very sore on this point and cannot forgive his mother for as he considers her the cause of his being confined to a rank beneath that in which he is entitled to shine captain left his widow two or three hundred a year on which she managed to live in a cheap part of the country she had previous to this time and in the of her husband s

and determined soldier within six years after he was leading parties himself fighting in  v fortress up to his waist in water and climbing under a furious fire with a pluck that would have satisfied even of arc in time he and cleared away all the english even from regions where the people had been under their for three hundred years in such regions wise and careful work was necessary for the english rule had been fair and kindly and men who have been ruled in that way are not always anxious for a change which of s five chief deeds shall we call chief est it is my thought that each in its turn was that this is saying that taken as a whole they each other and neither was then greater than its mate do you perceive each was a stage in an ascent to leave out one of them would defeat the journey to achieve one of them at the wrong time and in the wrong place would have the same effect by of arc consider the as a of where can you find its superior in our history did the king suspect its vast importance no did his ministers no did the representative of the english crown no an advantage of importance was here under the eyes of the king and of the king could get it by a bold stroke could get it without an effort but being ignorant of its value neither of them put forth his hand of all the wise people in high office in france only one knew the worth of this neglected prize  the child of seventeen of arc  and she had known it from the beginning had spoken of it from the beginning as an essential detail of her mission how did she know it it is simple she was a peasant that tells the whole story she was of the people and knew the people those others moved in a sphere and knew nothing much about them we make little account of that vague mass that mighty force which we call the people  an epithet which carries contempt with it it is a strange attitude for at bottom we know that the throne which the people support stands and that when that support is removed nothing in this world can save it now then consider this fact and observe its importance whatever the parish priest believes his by of arc flock believes they love him they him he is their friend their protector their in sorrow their in their day of need he has their whole confidence what he tells them to do that they will do with a blind and affectionate obedience let it cost what it may add these facts thoughtfully together and what is the sum this the parish priest the nation what is the king then if the parish priest withdraw his support and deny his authority merely a shadow and no king let him resign do you get that idea then let us proceed a priest is consecrated to his office by the awful hand of god laid upon him by his appointed representative on earth that is final nothing can undo it nothing can remove it neither the pope nor any other power can strip the priest of his office god gave it and it is forever sacred and secure the dull parish knows all this to priest and parish is of god bears an office whose authority can no longer be disputed or assailed to the parish priest and to his subjects the nation an king is a of a person who has been named for holy orders but has not been consecrated he has no office he has not been ordained another may be appointed in his place in a word an king is a doubtful king but if god him and his servant the bishop him the doubt is the priest and the parish are his loyal subjects straight by of arc way and while he lives they will recognize no king but him to of arc the peasant girl charles vii was no king until he was crowned to her he was only the that is to say the heir if i have ever made her call him king it was a mistake she called him the and nothing else until after the it shows you as in a mirror  for was a mirror in which the lowly hosts of france were clearly reflected  that to all that vast force called the people he was no king but only before his crowning and was and king after it now you understand what a colossal move on the political the was realized this by and by and tried to patch up his mistake by crowning his king but what good could that do none in the world speaking of s great acts may be to that game each move was made in its proper order and it was great and effective because it was made in its proper order and not out of it each at the time made seemed the greatest move but the final result made them all as equally essential and equally important this is the game as played moves and  check then moves the reconciliation  but does not proclaim check it being a move for position and to effect later by of arc next she moves the  check next the march  check final move after her death the reconciled to the french king s elbow  by chapter campaign of the had as good as  opened the

that t got none asked a great many questions about the money and the hole which uncle hoping to find money answered there was no evidence to half bound the world fasten the crime upon any one the facts that appeared were that the money in four bags had been deposited in the that an hour before the fire the had assured himself the gold was safe that after the fire the board had been found in its place as before but the gold was gone a dozen of the neighbors at least had been into the room and dock and mat had been the last to leave mr was sure that neither dock nor mat knew he had any money in the house there was no good reason for supposing they any more than any other of the neighbors had taken the gold after a long and careful examination of the premises and a patient inquiry into all the circumstances nothing could be brought forward to any person in the robbery not willing to believe yet that the gold had been stolen he went down cellar and surveyed the under the hole hoping that the bags had dropped through but he could not find them he could not determine whether or not there was any connection between the fa and the robbery but mr insisted that some one  he did not say now  intended to of fortune or born the house so as to cover up the crime or at least afford an opportunity to commit the how could any one set the fire in the roof asked they might have gone up there as you did replied the old man rather let us go up and see how the fire took added aunt had a big fire in the oven it couldn t up there if she did replied uncle as he followed his nephew up the ladder some of the boards and had been burned through but the were only went up to the chimney and examined the near it the house was a very old one and had been built upon ui til its present proportions had been reached the chimney where the fire had taken was in the most ancient part and the bricks were laid in clay found that three or four of them on one of the inside corners had dropped out this was the defect which the owner had repaired there is a great hole in the chimney said half bound the world u i know there is bat i stopped that up a month ago i hadn t no mortar nor nothing and i just nailed a board over the hole u that s the way the fire took added wondering at the carelessness of his uncle i didn t suppose there was any heat up here twenty foot from the fire replied the old man a aunt had a rousing fire in the oven the wind was pretty fresh and i suppose the sparks caught on the dry board it is clear enough to me that no one set the house on fire u i suppose they didn t then but somebody stole my money you ll prove that nobody didn t steal it a i am willing to take your word for that and the s visible sufferings were all sufficient to convince any person that the money was gone whether any one had stolen it or not tried in vain to obtain a to the lost treasure he knew of no one that had visited the house during the fire who was bad enough to steal unless it was dock but it was not right to of fortune or suspect even him of the crime without some evidence neither nor his uncle saw how dock could have taken off the board removed the bags and then restored the covering while there were so many people in the house dock after his discharge from the state prison had gone to new york where he had been employed as the mate of a steamer six months before the story opens his brother in boston had died and as the deceased had no family his property to twenty one thousand dollars had been equally divided among his two brothers and one sister dock fully believed that seven thousand dollars on cape ann would entirely w pe out the disgrace of having served a term in the state prison and he returned to dressed in a nice suit of black dock was mistaken seven thousand dollars would not his character so that good men would associate with him he and swelled and declared that he had been taken up for nothing that this was not a free country and that he was a better man than thousands in town who had never half sound the world been to the state prison he never forgave for his plans and swore that he would be the ruin of him and of mr the best friend dock had was and the was not willing to believe that dock had robbed him of his gold after went home that day his uncle persisted that he had stolen the money of fortune ob chapter iv the plank the chasm a week of indescribable misery to passed away but no trace of the robber or the money had been obtained the and the had visited the premises and carefully considered all the facts without affording the miserable man a of consolation he groaned from morning till night forlorn and desolate declaring that he should come to want and die in the probably the money the wretch had lost was not a fifth part of his fortune and he was in no more danger of coming to want than the sea was of being dried up but he felt as though he had lost all and if he had been stripped of everything he could hardly have	isabella-lucy-bird

however he did speak out with the idea of seeing what would happen i can supply the connection said he lightly but keenly observant of the old man s face my name appeared as a witness at an a week or so back ah now i remember mr quite so it was that square murder you have a good memory lord in this case you flatter me mr there is no difficulty in my remembering the especial case as mrs was a tenant of mine was not supposed to know this and displayed suitable surprise indeed he said then you have lost a good tenant possibly replied rather grimly she always paid her rent regularly you saw her yes my friend mr train was stopping in the house that young man cast a look in s direction i did not know he was there on that night he was a witness also said significantly i can t remember all the names sir well i stopped for the night with mr train and during the night mrs was murdered you heard you saw nothing i was sound asleep the whole time said calmly pulled at his gray in the very same way as george did when he was what a pity you might have discovered the i don t think the will ever be discovered that s luck for the rejoined the old lord you appear to be very certain mr george shrugged his shoulders no more certain than the police are he replied they examined every one in the house and no one could be accused  there was absolutely no evidence and the could not have entered the house as the door was locked and the key was in the pocket of the murdered woman for some reason appeared to be rather relieved i read all that in the papers he said roughly you are telling me nothing new but there you didn t say you would by the way you stopped at that house do you know a miss bull george nodded she told my fortune he said she told mrs s fortune also and a very true fortune did she tell said grimly what did she about you the usual thing said trouble i suppose these card people generally trouble as it is certain to occur there was trouble and enemies and the promise that i should get my wish said with a quick look laughed what is your wish if i tell it i won t get it replied george also laughing but i don t in it is rubbish the yellow it wasn t in mrs s case said the other who appeared to be a trifle superstitious oh that was a mere coincidence but you asked me about miss bull sir do you know her nodded she came to me on behalf of mrs s niece and wished the lease renewed i heard her story and consented i dare say the niece will be quite as good a tenant as the aunt this conversation was all very well but there was nothing to be learned from it on either side could not discover if his grandfather knew to whom he was speaking and found it impossible to learn if george could tell him anything of the case which had not been reported in the papers for some reason wished to know what had and felt convinced that this anxiety was more than that of a landlord for the loss of a good tenant he wondered if knew that mrs had written out a confession and that it was missing he would had liked to find out but since he could not reveal himself as s there was no chance of getting this information besides appeared to grow weary of discussing the murder it is worn he said all the papers have been talking about it i agree with you mr that the will never be discovered never said george looking full at the determined face of the old man are you quite sure i am sure of nothing in this world save that you said so yourself mr however there are pleasanter subjects to talk of what about your aims your your chances of success are those pleasant subjects laughed to an old man such as i am nodded the other i hke to hear of the castles in the air which youth i am afraid my castles will never turn to bricks and mortar said with a sigh however he was not averse to showing his grandfather that he was no fool but a man with a head on his shoulders george had a quick brain and a strong will and a considerable fund of information he had taken a good degree at oxford and his literary articles always received praise from the public and from his brethren of the press moreover was fond of politics and could converse on that fascinating subject he laid out to please knowing that the old tyrant was disappointed in the languid who was chattering commonplace to mrs ward in a short time and were engaged in a discussion about ireland and irish home rule and the old lord approved highly of s sentiments you ought to be in the house mr he said i have no one to help me to such a goal was about to speak and fastened his little eyes on the keen handsome face of the younger man but he suddenly changed his mind and turned away to talk to mrs ward knew that he had succeeded in pleasing the old gentleman and was glad that so

to these because it is the only way in which i can keep myself in the y f the  r who  me inventions of mine which will make in naval having nothing else to do i asked this curious american what his inventions might be and his replies very soon convinced me that i had to do with a madman he had some idea of making a ship go against the wind and against the current by means of coal or wood which was to be burned inside of her there was some other nonsense about floating barrels full of which would blow a ship to pieces if she struck against them i listened to him at the time with an indulgent smile but now looking back from the point of of my old age i can see that not all the warriors and in that room  no not even the emperor himself  have had as great an effect upon tlie history of the world as that silent american who looked so and so commonplace among the gold and the oriental dresses but suddenly our conversation was interrupted by a hush in the room  such a cold uncomfortable hush as comes over a of happy the reception of the children when a grave elder comes amongst them the and the laughter died away the sound of the rustling cards and of the had ceased in the other rooms men and women had risen to their feet a constrained expectant expression upon their faces and there in the doorway were the pale face and the green coat with the red across the white waistcoat there was no saying how he might behave upon these occasions sometimes he was capable of being the and most of the but this was rather in his than in his imperial days on the other hand he might be absolutely ferocious with an insulting observation for with whom he came in contact as a rule he was between these two extremes silent ill at ease shooting out little remarks which made uncomfortable there was always a sigh of relief when he would pass from one room into the next on this occasion he seemed to have not wholly recovered from the storm of the afternoon and he looked about him with a brooding eye and a lowering brow it chanced that i was not very far from the door and that his glance fell upon me come here de said he he laid his hand upon my shoulder and turned to a big gaunt man who had accompanied him into the room look here r s you uncle said he you always said that the old would never come back and that they would settle in england as the have done you see that as usual you have for here is the heir of the de come to offer his services de you are now my de camp and i beg you to keep with me wherever i go this was promotion indeed and yet i had sense enough to know that it was not for my own sweet sake that the emperor had done it but in order to encourage others to follow me my conscience approved what i had done for no sordid motive and nothing but the love of my country had prompted me but now as i walked round behind napoleon i felt and ashamed like a prisoner led behind the car of his and soon there was something else to make me ashamed and that was the conduct of him whose servant i had become his manners were outrageous as he had himself said it was his nature to be always first and this being so he resented those and by which men are accustomed to disguise from women the fact that they are the weaker sex the emperor unlike louis xiv felt that even a temporary and conventional attitude of humility towards a woman was too great a condescension from his own absolute chivalry was among those conditions of society which he refused to accept to the soldiers he was amiable enough with a nod and a joke for each of them to his sisters the reception of the also he said a few words though rather m the tone of a to a pair of it was only when the had joined him that his ill humour came to a head i wish you would not wear those of pink about your head said he all that women have to think about is how to dress themselves and yet they cannot even do that with moderation or taste if i see you again in such a thing i will thrust it in the fire as i did your shawl the other day you are so hard to please napoleon you like one day what you cannot abide the next but i will certainly change it if it you said with admirable patience the emperor took a few steps between the people who had formed a lane for us to pass through then he stopped and looked over his shoulder at the how often have i told you that i cannot fat women i always bear it in mind napoleon then why is madame de present but surely napoleon madame is not very fat she is than she should be i should prefer not to see her who is this he had paused before a young lady in a blue dress whose knees seemed to be giving way under her as the terrible emperor her with his searching eyes oe uncle this is de how old are you twenty three it is time that you were married every woman should be married at twenty three how is it that you are not married the poor girl appeared to be incapable of answering so the gently remarked that it was to the young men that that	edith-wharton

unexpected annoyance was early noted for miss cared not the snap of her finger about what the and newspapers did it was the of her mail with letters from men of individuals who apparently called themselves so her course and that their acquaintance would be to her personal advantage strong minded as was she so at these that she turned all her mail over to dr begging him to give her only such of it as he thought she would like to receive the beast in some men is so near the surface that it only requires the least encouragement to bring it into sight i looked over those letters with the physician an amateur learned that names famous enough to be known the country over had been signed to suggestions at which i cannot even hint strange as had been the conduct of george s daughter she always seemed to those of us who knew her best the very of high and modesty it would have required a not often found to say anything in her presence that of the creatures who wrote her the letters to which i have alluded were to be excused in a measure by the fact that they had not the slightest idea of the personality of that charming girl they knew nothing more than that she was a mother and unmarried which in itself let us admit in all was not of a nature had they seen her in the wondrous beauty of her young they must have shrunk abashed from their own base thoughts it can hardly be said that miss defied the world she rather ignored it she did not her conduct in its face but neither did she hide one of it from all who chose to gaze her delight in her little one was complete although she had a nurse especially for it she did most of the necessary offices herself a suggestion of a bottle was indignantly rejected wanted everybody to understand that she was not one of those mothers who steal for fashion or pleasure the months that belong to their offspring she rode out every afternoon with the child when the weather was fair not seeking to attract attention and yet going boldly to any point she liked regardless of the crowd it was not long before she got used to hearing the out of whispered that is she and sometimes the sup pressed of a silly woman who imagined she had a upon the subject more than this she encountered frowning eyes those of who said in audible voices i should think she would have shame enough to hide her head could not reply to such people without lowering herself by a combat and she chose the easier way of trying to live down their resentment time helped a great deal in this but as long as she remained in new york she never quite escaped being

was shaken to the foundation by his crime and its terrible consequences he was now like a man who had glided down a soft sunny slope and was suddenly arrested at the brink of a precipice was cunning selfish in reality long as he could appear respectable but he was not violent nor physically reckless still less cruel a deed of blood shocked him as much as it would shock an honest man now through following his natural bent too far and yielding to the influence of a villain he found his own hands stained with blood  the blood of a man who after all had been his best friend and had led him to fortune and the blood of an innocent girl who had not only been his pecuniary for a time but had warmed and lighted his house with her beauty and affection busy men whose views are all external are even more apt than others to miss the knowledge of their own minds this man to whom everything was business had taken for granted he did not actually love grace hope why she was another man s child but now he had lost her forever he found he had mistaken his own feelings he looked round his gloomy horizon and realized too late that he did love her it was not a great and penetrating love like william hope s he was incapable of such a sentiment but what affection he had to bestow he had given to this sweet creature his house was dark without her he was desolate and alone and horrible to think of the instrument of her this thought drove him to frenzy and his frenzy took two forms furious excitement and gloomy despair this was now his life by night and day for sleep deserted him at the mine his measures were all wise but his manner very wild the very whispered amongst themselves that he was going mad at home on the contrary he was gloomy with sullen despair he was in this latter condition the evening after the explosion when a visitor was announced thinking it was some one from the mine he said faintly admit him and then his head dropped on his breast indeed he was in a sort of worn out with his labors his remorse and his in that condition his ear was suddenly by a hard voice whose tone was somehow opposed to all the voices with which goodness and humanity have ever

somewhat confused hastened to prevent his saying more at so awkward a moment then as my friend i hope you will come and see me at i shall be delighted when do you go down within a fortnight i must remain that time in town to see my lawyer about the estate left by my poor father and see mrs no replied coldly now that my father is dead mrs is nothing to me indirectly i look upon her as the cause of his death for if she had not driven both of us of our own home my father might have been alive still i shall not call on mrs and i do not think she will dare to call on me i m not so sure of that

and leafy country when he should ask this goddess among women to be his wife if encouragement and looks and went for anything he hardly doubted the happy result in the meantime while dreamed his

surround the silent house acres as hinted did indeed try to see her she called twice and was refused admission into s presence she wrote three times and received no reply to her letters so the consequence was that finding declined to have anything to do with her in any way whatsoever she became very bitter this feeling she expressed to whom she one day met in as if i had done anything finished after a recital of all her i call it real mean don t you think so mr if you ask me mrs said stiffly i think you and miss are better apart of course you defend her but i guess i can t blame

through which a placid and slow flowing stream on either side of this water stretched broad meadow lands flat and fertile as well they might be seeing they were of rich black and well drained withal to the right these meadows were bounded by forest lands the trees of which grew thickly up and over the ridge and on the space where wood met fields was placed the a quaint square building of architecture and some two centuries old against the green of the trees its warm walls of red brick and sloping roof of slate made a pleasant spot of colour there stretched a terrace before it beneath the terrace a flower garden and orchard and below these the meadow lands white with snow in winter black in spring with and golden with grain in the hot days of summer altogether a lovely and peaceful

meaning of a thing so that in literary study we are likely to the impossible the of the emotions while all the force of the child s mind is concentrated upon the effort to comprehend may he done to lessen this stress a most desirable the  of the the of obscure passages obviously in this but so does tho pointing out of beauties instead of being ed in the midst of the effort to take in a poem or a play as a whole and being harassed by the need of details of or the student has a pleasant sense of self in coming obscure matters already conquered and in the same way receives both pleasure and a feeling of mastery in beauties already familiar i the preliminary work besides this study of any difficulties of should include i is needful in making clear any difference between the point of view of the work studied and that of i the child s ordinary life in the merchant of for instance it is necessary to clear the fact that the play was written for an audience to which was an intolerable crime and a jew a creature to be thoroughly detested the jew of recent years in europe helps to make thia the f talks on literature point be made because otherwise appears like a and tbe story is easily brought home to the school boy moreover by its close relation to the simplest emotions tbe two that has incurred the hatred of through his kindness to persons in trouble and that he comes within the range of danger through money to aid his friend are so closely allied to universal human feelings and universal experience that it is only needful to be sure these points are clearly perceived to have tbe sympathies of the class thoroughly awakened all this is so obvious that it is hardly necessary to say it except for tbe sake of not what is of so much real importance every teacher understands this and acts upon it to include this in the preliminary work may a contradiction of a previous statement that it is not wise to tell children what they are expected to get from any given book the two matters are entirely distinct what should be done is really that sort of giving of the point of view which we so commonly and so naturally exercise in telling an anecdote in conversation of all conceited men i ever met we say tom was the worst why once i saw him  and so on for the story which is thus declared to be an of vanity see we say to the class iu you must have felt sorry to see some kindly honest fellow cheated just because be was too to suspect the that cheated mm preliminary work here ia the story of a great splendid honest a noble general and a fine leader who was utterly ruined and brought to his death in just that way this is not drawing a moral and it seems to me entirely legitimate aid to tbe student it is less doing anything for them that they could and should do than it ia directing them so that they may advance more quickly and in tbe right direction this indication of the general direction in which the mind should move in considering a work is closely connected with what might be called establishing the proper point of departure this is neither more nor less than fixing the fact of common experience in the life of the pupil at which it seems safe and wise to begin what has been said about the way in which a teacher calls upon the experience of the pupils to bring home the picture of the village blacksmith at his is an indication of what is here meant in teaching history to day with a somewhat older grade of pupils than would be reading that poem of s an naturally makes vivid the of st by comparison with the reports of in our own time and in the same line the fact that it is so short a time since the king of was or that the present of turkey on his crown with the blood of his brothers may be made to assist a class to take the point of view necessary for the of the tragedy in i have already spoken page talks on teaching literature of the but even more vital way in which the vice of ambition that is so a motive power in that

measured voice and mask a wipe like face that they swept the two away from him he closed the door behind them and paced slowly up and down the room then he passed into the library and looked out over the wire blind the carriage was rolling away he caught a last glimpse of the woman who had been his wife he saw the feminine of her head and the curve of her beautiful throat under some foolish impulse he took a few quick steps towards the door then he turned and throwing himself into his study chair he plunged back into his work there was little scandal about this singular domestic incident the professor had few personal friends and seldom went into society his marriage had been so quiet that most of his had never ceased to regard him as a bachelor mrs and a few others might talk but their field for gossip was limited for they could only guess vaguely at the cause of this sudden separation the professor was as punctual as ever at his classes and as zealous in directing the work of those who studied under him his own private were pushed on with feverish energy it was no uncommon thing for his servants when they came down of a morning to hear round the red lamp the shrill of his pen or to meet him on the staircase as he ascended grey and silent to his room in vain his friends assured him that a life his health he lengthened his hours until day and night were one long ceaseless task gradually under this discipline a change came over his appearance his features always inclined to became even and more pronounced there were deep lines about his temples and across his brow his cheek was sunken and his complexion his knees gave under him when he walked and once when passing out of his lecture room he fell and had to be assisted to his carriage this was just before the end of the and soon after the holidays commenced the professors who still remained in were shocked to hear that their brother of the chair of had sunk so low that no es could be entertained of his recovery two eminent had consulted over his case without being able to give a name to the affection f which he suffered a steadily vitality appeared to be the only a bodily weakness which left the

of the liberty of the individual cell as opposed to the cell it is the dissolution of a co society the process is one of great interest and so one grey morning his co society dissolved very quietly and softly he sank into his eternal sleep his two felt some slight embarrassment when called upon to fill in his it is to give it a name said one very said the other if he were not such an man i

the young ladies intended to favour her with her company reasons well known to herself had decided on walking and she said so much more than the occasion required about being an excellent never feeling tired donkey c that without more took the vacant seat and the party set off mr his arm to walked next to her on the opposite side and for some little time the whole party continued together exchanging remarks on the scenery and the weather but presently coming to a steep cart track ran forward to support the chaise which seemed to him in imminent danger of losing its balance and he continued to keep his hand on the side rail while answering some inquiry of mrs s arrived at the end of the lane a fine down opened before them the donkey began to trot and to run still keeping his hold on the chaise elbow and continuing his laughing dialogue with the ladies which from the rattling of the wheels was necessarily carried on in a raised tone of voice the clear fresh air of the heath heightened the of and each of whom thought they had never seen the other look so handsome and the race continued till a slope in the downs carried them out of sight of and mr looked back them once or twice and asked her mother if they had not better wait that is easier said than done replied mrs smiling as she vainly pulled the rein our  donkey seems to have inspiration from the air i this best driving madam asked i thought you had been a better whip ah the rein you are your gloves more than his mouth this unwonted speed will soon depend upon it and we may as well await our companions at the foot of the next hill as any where else acting on this resolution they half traversed common in the mean while had been rather annoyed at being left behind with mr he had joined them she said to herself without being wanted by any body and now had completely broken up the party had not we better walk said she gently dragging him forward as she spoke they will be out of sight presently but no mr hung heavy on hand we cannot keep up with them said he and i dare say they will wait for us at the bottom of the slope oh don t trust to that cried eagerly for i know the holland s donkey of old and when it once takes to trotting on heath it never stops till it reaches the foot of white thorn hill in that case replied mr there is still less chance of our keeping up with them so you see it was a lucky thing i fell in with you or you would have been left to yourself no that i should not i am sure cried indignantly tossing her chin don t you think resumed she again endeavouring to her companion a little that we had better try to gain the slope at any rate before they are out of sight that we may see which track they take oh continued mr i know my way to the brow of the hill perfectly well but i am not so sure that mamma does interrupted if she loses her way replied he we are not for it since she has run away from us not we from her however we shall all meet at our journey s end i make no doubt could not help letting her lips betray that note of vol village impatience which can only be imperfectly implied on paper by the syllable tut the vexation was increased by her companion s coming to a full stop apparently for no other purpose than to scent the air delightful exclaimed he at length with a tone and countenance of keen enjoyment here indeed as your fa expresses it the sense is with of unexpected sweets my favourite repeated with contempt s favourite if you please i haye to taste for such dull writers who instead of giving airy a local habitation and a name describe just what is before their eyes and no more with the accuracy of a the lay of the last is worth all that a thousand could write the task too such a name enough to one at the very outset there is a great deal in a name though chose not to think so and fixed on one equally hateful to teacher and scholar very good said mr laughing there is much originality in what you say and i always derive amusement from your ideas though they are not  or more properly because they are not in exact accordance with my own as to your opinion on the subject of i agree with you that miss was very when she exclaimed what s in a name v and that she would have been compelled to answer a great deal if it could have been proved that the so called sign or had no right to any other than plain or her love would speedily have been in the bud we may be certain i myself am not a little proud of a name which associations with the noble the brave and the patriotic and mr would fall five per cent in your estimation i dare say if he were to turn out a mere smith or some people said have more to boast of than their names  why that is true too rejoined mr and i think you are among the number for is not a very striking name is pretty and italian like enough but has not much to recommend it take my advice therefore and change it as soon as possible village really mr exclaimed v ry really what miss

then the thing we now call marriage will be looked back upon as an unaccountable custom of a age out of mrs rallied to the emergency without delay you your own position said she boldly the greatest fault you ever found with a woman was her to become a mother in the time you will not she be even less willing to assume that position listened intently i wondered what they could be thinking of to utter such in her presence but they seemed to say them not only in spite of her being there but for her special benefit women will be honest when that time comes said and honesty is the chief of all virtues it seems to me the that to day is simply horrible women and men enter into a marriage contract in which certain things are and others understood then one of them deliberately with malice as the say sets to work to deceive the other in a point of first importance in other words she and her partner as no one would think of doing in any other business that is the way to make the world honest is to give woman greater freedom take away the to falsehood and she will rise above the petty that she now i do not blame you for me i cannot defend myself for my conduct toward mrs except on the principle by which we meet a with any weapon that is convenient when i discovered her deception i felt insulted robbed outraged i acted as a man driven wild is liable to act woman make her free and such questions cannot arise it will be for her to say whether she will be a mother and no man can question her an artificial rule decision to day she enters into a contract which common honesty requires her to keep and a contract by two persons cannot be broken at the whim of one of them without danger of protest when the discovery is made then he turned abruptly to my consternation and put this inquiry to what do you think about it dear the girl raised her sweet eyes to her father i don t know as i can tell you exactly she said i am sure i am almost sure at least that never shall marry and yet you told us a little while ago exclaimed mrs drew that it was the hope of your life to have a child of your own yes said softly turning her slow gaze toward the speaker it was with one movement that we looked at surely he would protest with vigor when he heard this home assumption of the doctrine he had been advancing but he only the hair of the daughter who was dearer than life to him and smiled at her with the same affectionate gaze chapter xiv an artificial rule i do not want to make my story more than is absolutely necessary to show you the way in which the central idea of miss s life out of was formed and grew until it controlled her actions most of us are what our and have made us the thoughts that fill our brains have not come there at random they are the product of what we have seen and heard and read combined with our natural and inherited and inclinations under other circumstances this girl would never have entertained the dreams that now influenced her under still other but different ones she would have had them by the counsels of those set to be her teachers and in order to understand how she has come to her present in spite of the world and has even had the courage to act upon them you must know each step she took on that strange path had loved his child from her birth indeed as he himself said to me more than once from a time long to it as she grew to woman s estate this love deepened into adoration whatever did was right her conduct must not be questioned he would have fought the universe for her sake convinced that a of opinion was worthless if it opposed hers in return she gave him the fullest confidence and veneration they talked together more like brother and sister husband and wife if you will than father and daughter he had never drawn any line that she feared to pass she asked him every question that came into her head as freely as if he were her mother and physician combined when reached the age of eighteen she began a study of medicine she seized upon its revelations with the of a young dr asked her if aw artificial she intended to practice and try to take his away from him he was astonished at the things she learned in an brief space of time she devoured the text books as if they were and clung to volumes of lectures with all the delight usually shown for a romance at the end of a year she triumphantly announced to the good physician that she knew as much as he in relation to one of the greatest problems of life and yet she added thoughtfully i know no more than every woman ought to know i have only got acquainted with myself how do so many dare enter a state of with their eyes blinded by total ignorance always you must not get false ideas my child said dr while there are women too ignorant there is also such a thing as being too wise in what way she asked eagerly you know a great deal doctor and i want you to be frank if you think i am making a mistake well to be plain he replied our great knew almost nothing about these things and yet they got along very well nature is worth on a little she has done pretty fairly take it altogether	arthur-conan-doyle
figures he found that the cost of living at his house had actually increased since the of the servant girl department young ma had a good deal to learn about cooking and doubtless spoiled many things in the process of acquiring knowledge they had to have a woman any way to wash and iron and to do heavy work and he concluded that it would be best to look up a good one as soon as possible if he could find one a little older than his wife who would use judgment and not get into a clash with her it would be best he went into the intelligence office on his way to his place of business and described what he wanted he told them he was willing to pay the right salary to the right person he might as well make up his mind that the old cost of living when he was a bachelor would never be again he realized fully that the cooking since mrs s day had been much poorer and that after the departure of it was far from what it was before that time but was not an it took something more than a badly done or a burned roast to put him out of temper he had said little when things were at their worst so long as the meals were served on the exact moment when they were due however if he could get a woman to do the work who would act as a sort of housekeeper at the same time he would like it one who would know as neither he nor his wife did whether the provision account was right during the day he went to the and market and paid the bills they had sent him he himself on owing no one beyond the time when the account was presented a week later he found the very woman for whom he was searching a scotch widow who wanted a home and who was ready to undertake the work of his small establishment at the same wages he had paid young fa s it did not require much urging for to agree to try her though she declared that no woman should her house over her head and that if mrs attempted it there would be trouble was glad when the arrangement was made a state of things approaching that of the old times seemed to come again with the advent of the new servant everything about the kitchen and was made as neat as a pin and on the moment when the clock announced the hour for each meal it was neatly and served the young husband made one or two mistakes by mrs too strongly to his wife who resented the that her cooking had not been satisfactory but this caused only temporary the interrupted

cause she gave him answers to all his suggestions of various or of calling the doctor she turned a deaf ear there was something the matter with her stomach that was evident and he tried to make her think of what she had eaten feeling sure that the difficulty could easily be traced all that he said seemed only to annoy her and the returned at frequent intervals much alarmed sought the counsel of mrs is very ill he said and refuses to let me get a doctor won t you see if there is anything you can do for her the scotch woman eyed him narrowly it was evident that his anxiety was real she wondered how a young s man of his size and years could be so ignorant ye ken what s the matter wi her she asked there was something in the tone that told him all quite confused he withdrew from the kitchen and returned to his wife my darling he murmured bending over her had taken on a new glory in his eyes no man more desired every child in the world was to him a young every mother a endowed with the attributes of deity and it was to be his little who should wear that crown of he had supposed that it would come some time but the sudden revelation was nearly she was in truth such a child herself that could hardly be thought of in her case he reflected with the utmost regret that he had tried to mould her too rapidly into a full grown woman that he had acted toward her as if she had ten years more on her pretty shoulders how sorry he was now for every impatient word he had ever let fall he whispered i wish i could tell you how much i love you she turned her head away and cried on the pillow she was frightened at what made him so happy her first sensations were not calculated to her and for the time the girl the woman she shook her head doubtfully when he told her that she would be dearer to him than she could imagine and that never never as long as he lived would he speak another cross syllable to her all this was very pleasant for loved her husband but the would not respond to the mental treatment and she continued physically y un s miserable devoted himself to her like a lover and at the end of a few days she had recovered considerably her drooping spirits

for i did not wish to do anything or in a hurry it was very necessary to move silently now since i was within a few feet of my man with only the thin wooden between age had and cracked the boards so that when i had at last very stealthily crept my way as far as the sliding i found that i could without any difficulty see into the room captain stone was standing by the dressing table with his coat and off a large pile of sovereigns and several slips of paper were lying before him and he was counting over his gambling gains his face was flushed and he was heavy from want of sleep and from wine it rejoiced me to see it for it meant that his slumber would be deep and that all would be made easy for me i was still watching him when of a sudden i saw him start and a terrible expression come upon his face for an instant my heart stood still for i feared that he had in some way divined my presence and then i heard the voice of my master within i could not see the door by which he had entered nor could i see him where he stood but i heard all that he had to say as i watched the captain s face flush fiery red and then turn to a livid white as he listened to those bitter words which told him of his my revenge was sweeter  far sweeter  than my most pleasant dreams had ever pictured it i saw my master approach the dressing table hold the papers in the flame of the candle throw their ashes into the grate and sweep the golden pieces into a small brown canvas bag then as he turned to leave the room the captain seized him by the wrist imploring him by the memory of their mother to have mercy upon him and i loved my master as i saw him drag the s story his sleeve from the grasp of the clutching fingers and leave the stricken wretch upon the floor and now i was left with a difficult point to settle for it was hard for me to say whether it was better that i should do that which i had come for or whether by holding this man s guilty secret i might not have in my hand a and more deadly weapon than my master s hunting knife i was sure that lord could not and would not expose him i knew your sense of family pride too well my lord and i was certain that his secret was safe in your hands but i both could and would and then when his life had been and he had been fi om his regiment and fi om his clubs it would be time perhaps for me to deal in some other way with him you are a black villain said my uncle we au have our own feelings sir charles and you will permit me to say that a may resent an injury as much as a gentleman though the of the is denied to him but i am telling you frankly at lord s request all that i thought and did upon that night and i shall continue to do so even if i am not fortunate enough to win your approval when lord had left him the captain stone remained for some time in a kneeling attitude with his face sunk upon a chair then he rose and paced slowly up and down the room his chin sunk upon his breast every now and then he would pluck at his or shake his clenched hands in the air and i saw the moisture upon his brow for a time i lost sight of him and i heard him drawer after drawer as though he were in search of something then he stood over by his again with his back turned to me his head was thrown a little back and he had both hands up to the collar of his shirt as though he were striving to undo it and then there was a as if a had been upset and down he sank upon the ground with his head in the comer twisted round at so strange an angle to his shoulders that one glimpse of it told me that my man was slipping swiftly from the clutch in which i had fancied that i held him i slid my and was in the room in an instant his eyelids still quivered and it seemed to me as my gaze met his eyes that i could read both recognition and surprise in them i laid my knife upon the floor and i stretched myself out beside him that i might whisper in his ear one or two little things of which i wished to remind him but even as i did so he gave a gasp and was gone the s story it is singular that i who had never feared him in life should be frightened at him now and yet when i looked at him and saw that all was motionless save the creeping stain upon the carpet i was seized with a sudden foolish of terror and catching up my knife i fled swiftly and silently back to my own room closing the behind me it was only when i had reached it that i found that in my mad haste i had carried away not the hunting knife which i had taken with me but the bloody which had dropped from the dead man s hand this i concealed where no one has ever discovered it but my fears would not allow me to go back for the other as i might perhaps have done had i foreseen how terribly its presence might tell against my master and that lady	edith-wharton

he passed us into the huge tent which was save for a row of wooden benches round the sides a number of men in naval and military were seated upon these and numerous groups were standing about in subdued tones at the far end was a door which led into the imperial council chamber now and then i saw some man in official dress walk up to this door scratch gently upon it with his nail and then as it instantly opened slip through closing it softly behind him over the whole assembly there hung an air of the court rather than of the camp an atmosphere of awe and of reverence which was the more impressive when it affected these bluff soldiers and sailors the emperor had seemed to me to be formidable in the distance but i found him even more overwhelming now that he was close at hand you need have no fears de said my companion you are going to have a good reception how do you know that from general s manner in these by uncle cursed courts if the emperor smiles upon you smiles down to that in the red velvet coat yonder but if the emperor hy you have only to look at the face of the man who the imperial plates and yon will see the frown reflected upon it and the worst of it is that if you are a plain man you may never find out what earned you either the frown or the smile that is why i had rather wear the shoulder of a lieutenant and be at the side of my with a good horse between my knees and my against my than have s grand hotel in the saint and his hundred thousand of income i was still wondering whether the could be right and if the smile with which d greeted me could mean that the emperor s tions towards me were friendly when a very tall and handsome young man in a brilliant uniform came towards me in spite of the change in his dress i recognised him at once as the general who had commanded the expedition of the night before by ic the well de said he shaking hands with me very pleasantly you have heard no doubt that this fellow escaped us he was really the only one whom we were anxious to seize for the other is evidently a mere and but we shall have him yet and between ourselves we shall keep a very strict guard upon the emperor s person until we do for master is not a man to be despised i seemed to feel his great rough thumb upon my chin as i answered that i thought he was a very dangerous man indeed the emperor will see you presently said he is very busy this morning but he bade me say that you should have an audience he smiled and passed on assuredly you are getting on whispered there are a good many men here who would risk something to have address them as he addressed you the emperor is certainly going to do something for you but attention friend for here is de himself coming towards us a singular looking person was shuffling in our by uncle direction he was a man about fifty years of age largely made about the shoulders and chest but stooping a good deal and heavily in one leg he walked slowly leaning upon a stick and his sober suit of black with silk stockings of the same hue looked strangely staid among the brilliant which surrounded him but in spite of his plain dress there was an expression of great authority upon his shrewd face and every one drew back with bows and as he moved across the tent louis de said he as he stopped in front of me and his cold grey eyes played over me from head to heel i bowed and with some coldness for i shared the which my father used to profess for this priest and but his manner was so polished and engaging that it was hard to hold out against it i knew your cousin de very well indeed said he we were two together when the world was not quite so serious as it is at present i believe that you are related to the cardinal de de who is also an old friend by the room of mine i understand that you are about to offer your services to the emperor i have come from england for that purpose sir and met with some little adventure immediately upon your arrival as i understand i have heard the story of the worthy police agent the two and the lonely hut well you have seen the danger to which the emperor is exposed and it may make you the more zealous in his service where is your uncle he is at the castle of do you know him well i had not seen him until yesterday he is a very useful servant of the emperor but  but  he inclined his head downward to my ear some more congenial service will be found for you de and so with a bow he round and tapped his way across the tent again why my friend you are certainly destined  for something great said the lieutenant de does not waste his smiles and his bows i promise you he knows which way the wind blows before he flies his and i foresee that i shall be asking for your interest l by uncle to get me my in this english

new views are probably than his old ones but the insanity lies in his sudden change and in his violent of speech it was some weeks however before i gained his confidence so far as to be able to hold a real conversation with him for a long time he the letters was very sullen and suspicious the constant watch which i kept upon him this could not be relaxed for he was full of the most tricks one day he got hold of my tobacco and stuffed two of my tobacco into the long barrel of an eastern gun which hangs on the wall he it all down with the and i was never able to get it up again another time he threw an through the window and would have sent the clock after it had i not prevented him every day i took him for a two hours constitutional save when it rained and then we walked for the same space up and down the room but it was a deadly dreary kind of life i was supposed to have my eye upon him all day with a two hour interval every afternoon and an evening to myself upon but then what was the use of an evening to myself when there was no town near and i had no friends whom i could visit i did a fair amount of reading for lord let me have the run of his library gave me a couple of weeks you know the the letters effect that he produces you seem to be serenely floating upon a cloud and looking down on all these armies and with a wise ever at your side to whisper to you the inner meaning of all that majestic now and again young introduced some excitement into my dull life on one occasion when we were walking in the grounds he suddenly snatched up a from a and rushed at an under gardener the man ran screaming for his life with my patient cursing at his very heels and me within a few paces of him when i at last laid my hand on his collar he threw down his weapon and burst into shrieks of laughter it was only mischief and not ferocity but when that under gardener saw us coming after that he was off with a face like a cream cheese at night the attendant slept in a camp bed at the foot of the patient s and my room was next door so that i could be called if necessary no it was not a very life we used to go down to family meals when there were no visitors and there we made a the letters curious as he wished me to call him and silent i with the tail of my eye always twisted round to him lady with her eyelids and her blue veins and the good natured peer and genial but always rather subdued in the presence of his wife she looked as if a glass of good wine would do her good and he as if he would be the better for and so in accordance with the usual of life he drank freely and she took nothing but and water you cannot imagine a more ignorant narrow minded woman than she if she had only been content to be silent and hidden that small brain of hers it would not have mattered but there was no end to her bitter and what was she after all but a thin pipe for conveying disease from one generation to another she was bounded by insanity upon the north and upon the south i resolutely set myself to avoid all argument with her but she knew with her woman s instinct that we were as far apart as the poles and took a pleasure in waving the red flag before me one day she was the letters eloquent as to the crime of a minister of an church performing any service in a chapel some neighbouring minister had done it it seems and if he had been marked down in a pot house she could not have spoken with greater i suppose that my eyes were less under control than my tongue for she suddenly turned upon me with i see that you don t agree with me dr i replied quietly that i did not and tried to change the conversation but she was not to be shaken off why not may i ask i explained that in my opinion the tendency of the age was to break down those ridiculous points which are so useless and which have for so long set people by the ears i added that i hoped the time was soon coming when good men of all would throw this lumber overboard and join hands together she half rose almost speechless with indignation i presume said she that you are one of the letters those people who would separate the church from the state most certainly i answered she stood erect in a kind of cold fury and swept out of the room began to chuckle and his father looked perplexed i am sorry that my opinions are to lady i remarked yes yes it s a pity a pity said he well well we must say what we think but it s a pity you think it  a very great pity i quite expected to get my dismissal over this business and indeed indirectly i may say that i did so from that day lady was as rude to me as she could be and never lost an opportunity of making attacks upon what she imagined to be my opinions of these i never took the slightest notice but at last on an evil day she went for me point blank so that there was no getting away from her it was just at the end of lunch when	edith-wharton
seen at all hours of daylight beating on great stones the delicate and elaborate the golden of the european ladies of the ceaseless rush and hum of industry and of the overpowering astonishing chinese element which is gradually turning into a chinese city i must conclude abruptly or lose the mail i l b letter st s cathedral letter viii ss rainbow roads yesterday i attended morning service in st s a fine cathedral prettily situated on a broad grass lawn among of trees near the sea there is some stained glass in the but in the other windows including those in the shutters take the place of glass as in all the european houses there are thirty two and the indians who worked them any one of whom might have been the model of the of the museum sat or outside the church the service was simple and the music very good but in the te just at the verse thou art the king of glory christ i caught sight of the bronze faces of these mostly and was overwhelmed by the of the small progress which christianity has made upon the earth in nineteen centuries a d d preached an able sermon just before the communion we were called out as the rainbow was about to sail and a harbour boat by six splendid put us on board the rainbow is a very small vessel her captain half and half her crew chinese and her cabin passengers were all chinese merchants her engineer is a a kindly soul who assured mr when he commended me to his care that he was a family the golden viii man and that nothing gave him greater pleasure than seeing that ladies were comfortable and i owe to his good offices the very small of comfort that i had waiting on the little bridge was far from being wearisome there was such a fascination in watching the and manifold life of the harbour the sullen looking from europe cargo into of all sizes but one form sharp at both ends and with eyes on their bows like the and china boats as though they would upset under large mat sails and boats rowed by handsome a steamer from was six hundred in most picturesque and there were boats with men in crimson and graceful robes of pure white muslin and others a mass of blue while some contained with the mark of caste set on their all moving in a veil of gold in the setting of a heavy fringe of palms we sailed at four with a strong favourable breeze and the sea was really delightful as we passed among green clothed down to the water s edge with dense tropical vegetation right out into the open water of the straits of a burning sea into which the sun was descending in mingled flame and blood then dinner for three consisting of an excellent was spread on the top of the cabin and eaten by the captain engineer and myself after which the engineer took me below to arrange for my comfort and as it was obviously impossible for me to sleep in a very dirty and very small hole by large and with a temperature of eighty eight degrees he took a and pillows upon the bridge told me his history and that of his coloured wife and sixteen children under seventeen of his pay of  a month lent letter viii chinese me a box of matches and vanished into the lower regions with the words if you want anything in the night just call engineer down the engine it does one s heart good to meet with such a the is one of the many tokens of chinese influence in the straits of the tickets are chinese as well as the and crew the who took my ticket is a sleek young in a and white cotton trousers the cabin passengers are all the deck was packed with chinese on their way to seek wealth in the at p they were lean yellow and ugly smoked a pipe of each at wore their round their heads and loose blue cotton trousers we had slipped our cable at because these were up over every part of the vessel and all attempts to keep them out so that to cut and run was our only chance the owners do not allow any to be brought on board lest it should be given to the captain and crew and they should take too much and lose the vessel i am the only european passenger and the only woman on board i had a very comfortable night lying on deck in the brisk breeze on the sea and though i watched the stars hoping to see the southern cross set i fell asleep till i was awoke at the very earliest dawn by a most formidable oriental shouting to me very fiercely i thought with a fierce face but it occurred to me that he was trying to make me understand that they wanted to wash decks so i lifted my on a bench and fell asleep again waking to find the anchor being let go in the roads six hours before we should have arrived i am greatly interested with the first view of the golden letter one of the oldest european towns in the east originally then dutch and now though under english rule mainly chinese there is a long bay with dense forests of palms backed by forests of i know not what then rolling hills and to the right beyond these a mountain known as mount rich in gold is this possibly as many think the of the bible and this land of gems and

at him he turned his face half round and cocked an eye at him over his shoulder it seemed to the young englishman that he had never seen so hideous a face for the eyes were of the green the nose was broken and driven inward while the whole countenance was and with wounds the voice too when he spoke was as deep and r s the growl of a beast of prey young man said he i know not who you may be and i am not much inclined to myself but if it were not that i am bent upon taking my ease i swear by the sword of that i would lay my dog whip across your shoulders for daring to fill the air with these taken at this speech scarce knowing how to answer it in the presence of the lady stood with his hand upon the handle of the door while sir and his companion dismounted at the sound of ti these fresh voices and of the tongue m which they spoke the stranger his dish of nuts down upon the floor and himself to call for the landlord until the whole house re echoed with his with an face the white host came running at his call his hands shaking and his hair with apprehension for the sake of god he whispered as he passed speak him fair and do not rouse him for the love of the virgin he mild with him who is this then asked sir was about to explain when a fresh roar from the stranger interrupted him thou villain he shouted mid i not ask yon when i brought my lady here whether your inn was clean you did did i not very particularly ask you whether there were any in it you did and you answered me that there were not and yet ere i have been here an hour i find englishmen crawling about within it where are we to be free from this race can a frenchman upon french land not sit down in a french without having his ears pained by the of their hideous talk send them packing or it may be the worse for them and for you i will i will cried the frightened host and from the room while the soft soothing voice of a woman was heard with her furious companion indeed gentlemen you had best go said mine host it is but six to where there are very good quarters at he sign of the lion nay answered sir i cannot go until i have seen more of this person for he appears to be a man from whom much is to be hoped what is his name and title s it is not for my lips to name it unless by his desire but i beg and pray you gentlemen that you will go from my house for i know not what may come of it if his rage should gain the mastery of him by st sir this is certainly a man whom it is worth far to know go tell him that a humble knight of england would make his further honorable acquaintance not from any presumption pride or ill will but for the advancement of chivalry and the glory of our ladies him greeting from sir and say that the glove which i bear in my cap belongs to the most and lovely of her sex whom i am ready to against any lady whose claim he might be desirous of advancing the landlord was hesitating whether to carry this message or no when the door of the inner room was flung open and the stranger bounded out like a from his den his hair and his face with anger still here he dogs of england must ye be lashed hence my sword he turned to seize his weapon but as he did so his gaze fell upon the of sir s shield and he stood staring while the fire in his strange green eyes softened into a sly and humorous twinkle cried he it is my little of i should remember that coat seeing that it is but three days since i looked upon it in the lists by ah i sir sir i you owe me a return for this and he touched his right arm which was round just under the shoulder with a silken but the surprise of the stranger at the sight of sir was as nothing compared with the astonishment and the delight which shone upon the face of the knight of as he looked upon the strange face of the frenchman twice he opened his mouth and twice he peered again as though to assure himself that his eyes had not played him a trick hi he gasped at last du by saint shouted the french soldier with a hoarse roar of laughter it is well that i should with my down for he that has once seen my face does not need to be told my name it is indeed i sir and here is my hand i i give you my word that there are but three englishmen in this world whom i would touch save with the sharp edge of the sword the prince is one the second and you the third for i have heard much that is good of you i am growing aged and am somewhat spent in the wars sir but i can lay by my sword now with an easy mind for i can say that i have crossed swords with him who hath the heart and the strongest arm of all this great kingdom of france i have longed for it i have dreamed of it and now i can scarce bring my mind to understand that this great honor hath indeed been mine by the virgin of you have given me cause to be very certain of it	edith-wharton
at any rate whatever took place was for the mutual pleasure and satisfaction of all concerned and there is no reason to find fault with it at this late date with the horrors he had dreamed of still ringing in his head mr gray demanded an explanation of these why said the so called were whose death was decided upon in some form they had been guilty usually of making war against a superior force and according to the old custom would have been without mercy perhaps with preliminary torture if they had not been sent here with a sword in his hand one of these men died a thousand times as happily as if delivered to the in another way while his blood was hot in his veins he hardly felt the stroke that ended his misery they gave him the privilege of dying like a man instead of like a brute and at the same time the were taught a valuable lesson of the power of government to punish its enemies as for the lions and and that sort of thing i don t suppose you need a on the advantage of getting them out of the way the listener looked incredulous he had heard one of those arguments that do not convince however strong the logic may appear to be but the he asked the most perfectly contented people imaginable was the cool reply according to their love gone a doctrine they were going straight to eternal bliss the moment the animals got fairly to dining you or i would seize their chance this minute if we were sure the bargain would be carried out they were satisfied the spectators were pleased there was really no one in the whole affair who had the slightest right to complain it was a strange statement and somehow gray did not believe his companion meant it to be taken in earnest hope you found that business of yours all right the matter you mentioned at said gray as they passed along the streets i should say so was the warm reply not only did i recover all i had lost but a great deal more i could lend you fifty thousand to night on good security and not myself in the least as gray had no wish to borrow he did not accept the opportunity it occurred to him that mr might propose to the old loan but it seemed preposterous to suggest such a thing to a gentleman who boasted such present possessions as he walked along he also noticed several rings of no small value on his companion s fingers and when the began to strike mr drew out an elegant gold watch with the remark that it was well to have an accurate in a place where no two of those on the churches agreed with each other i don t suppose i shall be likely to meet you again said mr gray politely when they came to a point where their paths i don t know as to that said with an i could lend you fifty thousand that seemed habitual to him i am going away in a day or two but you may see me somewhere if you stay in europe i shall dance attendance in these parts at one place and another the rest of the winter i suppose my home address is on the card i gave you at if you still have it said gray oh yes i still have it replied and added into whose mind there kept coming in spite of him the two hundred you are not ready to tell me yet i presume your real name mr reflected a moment not quite yet he said presently my reasons for preserving an still exist in a few months i hope they will have disappeared upon arriving at his hotel gray was met by the with a very grave face mr had died suddenly they told him about an hour before love gone a chapter iv becoming a death is something for which no matter how long we may have looked upon it as imminent we are never prepared the dead mr was like a new acquaintance and entirely different from the living mr whom mr gray had come to know very well all the young man could do was to carry out for the dead the wishes that had been expressed by the living one though he was not certain that the latter had any right to dispose of the former without his consent it did not seem as if any man dead or alive would desire to be into a coffin and have the cover down over his face while he took a long sea voyage and afterwards elect to be put five feet deep in a there to remain forever yet these were the directions the living man had given long before when he had talked of the possibilities which he did not believe would but which now had occurred and mr gray saw no way but to obey the of the voice that had spoken since the tongue could utter nothing more although it was well into the winter the friends living and dead took passage for the united states the was made in the corner of a where other generations of had long since lain this matter disposed of mr gray was ready to listen becoming a to the statements of his guardian s now become by virtue of that position a person of peculiar importance to him this was a lawyer named one of those men who

with rage you shall never lower yourself by marrying that boy he exclaimed and i will tell you another thing i have arranged to have my will re drawn so that you should inherit my wealth which he has by his conduct if you persist in this insane folly i will give you nothing laughed actually laughed at him when is ready he will come for me she said he will come for me and i shall go with him he is under no obligations to you now you cannot frighten him any more yes you may as well understand mr stared at the girl would you give up a million dollars for him he asked indeed yes a hundred millions it rose to his lips to tell her that she might go from under his roof at once that he would harbor such an ungrateful thing no longer but he restrained himself before proceeding to such an extremity he wanted to talk with mrs he rose hesitated a moment tried to speak and then left the chamber he had accomplished nothing and less than nothing and tom knew as much before a word was spoken when his employer re entered the library and found him there smoking his pipe in his chapter xx confound his money when met on the evening following the troubles in mr s office he gave her a rather full account of what had occurred there besides as much as was necessary of the circumstances which had led up to the final catastrophe the girl listened silently as he told the story of of s wild for her of his uncle s wrath of the letter sent to his care and of the complete between the relations she hardly tasted the food set before her though her appetite for the french dinner which they were now in the habit of taking together was generally good was flattered by the close attention she gave him and rattled on for fully ten minutes pausing only long enough to take an occasional of the soup or fish i was so sorry that i didn t know what to do he said after describing the manner in which and he had left the office he says i m not the least bit to blame but i can t help thinking i am he looked at as if he wanted her opinion on the subject and she replied in a low voice that she could not see how he could have acted differently i am glad to hear you say so said he as if re at he has done so much for me that i shall always feel indebted to him but now i have something to tell you that will it is possible interest you even more than the recital i have already made it concerns yourself roused herself from the into which she had fallen and inquired what meant when we found ourselves both together thrown out upon the world he answered we went down to his rooms and held a council of war the agreement that we reached was to share everything we had and all we could earn for he is going to look for work as well as i our greatest necessarily being economy we began to consider what was the most way of living outside of a cheap boarding house which would not think of for a moment we finally decided to rent a low flat and to engage a housekeeper the girl s eyes opened wider as she heard this statement noticed their peculiar expression and stopped to inquire whether she saw any objections to the plan i am afraid a good housekeeper such as you would require is not the easiest thing to find she said you need an experienced woman to begin with one who would look out for your interests and you could not afford i suppose to pay very high wages was obliged to laugh at her description i think we know just where the right person can be found he replied she certainly has had experience for she was employed several months in a his country hotel she would look out for our interests because she knows us intimately and would share our home on equal terms as for compensation she is not at the present time earning much more than her living she would be much better off managing a home of her own for such it really would be besides doing a genuine kindness to two young men it was more than a minute before spoke again she could not fail to understand that he referred to her and at first she shrank from the proposition with a vague dread more than this she did not know as she had a right to live under the same roof with mr s nephew it was hardly keeping

of addition he was a confirmed and a very comfortable sort of fellow at the moment when he is introduced to the reader he was gazing into a love at seventy heap of coals which burned brightly in the grate before him both the book keeper and his companion suddenly became aware that there was a knock at the outer door of the counting room at least they knew that either this had happened or that the wind which was very boisterous had blown so severely against the building as to convey the impression that some one wished to enter the book keeper looked at mr who in return looked at the book keeper and the was that called come in in an elevated tone of voice the door opened slowly and closed behind a young man or it might be more correct to say lad for he did not look more than seventeen or eighteen years of age he was dressed notwithstanding the extreme coldness of the day and his features wore a pinched look such as is usually taken for a sign of physical suffering have you any work that i could do sir inquired the directing his question to the as mr was partly concealed from view by one of the large chairs in the room the book keeper was plainly annoyed he had been interrupted at the very worst time before he could find words the intruder knew by the unpleasant expression of his face what to expect no no replied we ve got nothing for you come be off the last exclamation was caused by the hesitation of the and his evident desire to the picturesque and poor conversation mr glancing from his seat by the fire saw the disappointed expression one that was not far from indicating genuine pain he moved his chair slightly and surveyed the with interest well are you going repeated seeing that the still remained we have nothing for you in any shape the works are all full and there is no prospect of a be sure and shut the door as you have already let in a good deal of cold the attitude of the young fellow changed with marvellous rapidity under the words and manner with which he had been received he raised his head and threw at the book keeper a glance of defiance i am poor and i am cold and i am hungry he said in a firm voice but that is no reason why you should speak to me like a dog i asked you for work not for charity and you might have replied in decent language this conversation occupied but a few seconds but it gave mr time to take a minute survey of the boy he saw at once that he had a fine face most intelligent eyes and an air that does not usually accompany such poor garments as he wore he noticed also that the lad s hands which were entirely bare were well shaped and very delicate although the outside the window far below the point he had no overcoat the extreme of his countenance was like at that of one recently recovered from a severe illness and this gave his eyes an unusually large appearance the angry look which flashed into them when he replied to the book keeper s words caused them to light up in a way quite attractive to any one but the object of their wrath he is very picturesque muttered mr beneath his breath feeling the necessity of doing something to preserve his dignity from the of the youth us left his stool and figures and approached him get out of here he said sharply or i ll put you out i ll h you manners beggar for answer the young fellow who was much and shorter than his clenched his thin hands but did not move an inch he evidently had no intention of being without a protest his eyes which had been dark before seemed to flash fire from out their depths his teeth white and even showed set and determined beneath the pale lips there could be but one issue to a contest so unequal but if imagined that he was to have his own way in the he had evidently made a how very picturesque he is murmured the young gentleman by the fire again then in a louder voice he addressed himself to the let him alone i want to talk to him the tone in which this was said was the most ordinary one in the world but there are two classes of beings who know and obey their masters without hesitation was a member of one of these classes and though mr was in one sense no master of his he knew that the time might come when he would be and had a due regard for the bread and butter question on that future day at this moment the piercing whistle of the works blew indicating the hour of noon the book keeper recognized the welcome sound and a sense of pleasure at his approaching dinner overpowered every other feeling he took down a heavy overcoat from an adjacent closet turning up the ample collar above his neck put on his fur gloves and hat the clad visitor with that contempt which well dressed people very properly have for their in this regard and finally by him as if he were some specimen of made his exit from

the high price of the and its easy transport its culture is on the rice and lands the consequences of the extension of its cultivation are serious it is admitted by the natives of that one great reason of the deficient food supply which led to the famine and distress in the eastern part of the province in was the giving of so much ground to the that there was no longer a margin left on which

chinese sources that in several of the large cities of the province eighty per cent of the men and forty per cent of the women are but this must not be understood to mean that they are for there is a vast amount of moderate smoking in china in my boat on the fourteen out of sixteen very poor smoked and among my chair and baggage it was rare to find one who did not smoke and who did not about the same hour daily with the so called craving the stem of my boat was a downright den at night with fourteen ragged men curled up on their with their lamps beside them in the height of felicity dreaming such dreams as never visit the toiling day of a chinese and incapable of rousing themselves to meet an emergency until the effect of the pipe passed off farther still the pan and his shrieking of a wife lay in the same case the face of the pan expressive in the of nothing but with its muscles relaxed and its deep hard lines smoothed out some of these men whose thin worn cotton rags were ill

to wait with true chinese patience for one two or three years certain that the owner will sooner or later part with it for an old song to satisfy his craving when he has sold all else it is common for the chinese to say if you want to be on your enemy you need not strike him or go to law with him  you have only to him into smoking the chinese condemn all but most moderate smoking and gambling as twin vices and not a voice is raised in defence of either of them even by the themselves the habit is regarded as a disease for the cure of which many voluntarily place themselves in at some expense and at a great cost of suffering and in the market towns thronged with native there is to be seen on many among innumerable native and a remedy for foreign smoke foreign smoke being the usual name for

show that there must have been regularly organized on the islands for a very long period with a civilization and which though utterly unworthy of christianity were enlightened and advanced for the office was hereditary and the king s power absolute on the different islands the kings and chiefs who together constituted a privileged class admitted the to some portion of their privileges probably with the view of the people more completely through the agency of religion and held the lower classes in absolute by the most of systems which included or forced labour and the well known throughout a

was said about the dangers of the deep the welcome home that both of them gave him was of a kind that would have gone far to influence his future had he not been to everything in that direction he thought in the pauses of the their marriage bond tion of the imperative necessity to let these people understand his true situation regarding them before many days had passed and the that were certain to arise filled him with dismal himself at an early hour on the plea that his father was sitting up for him strolled back to his home it was impossible for edward to let the occasion pass without alluding to the marriage or speaking of the congratulations that had been upon the match from all sides i don t believe you half realize even yet what a lucky chap you are he said with a chuckle your

be yours and you are already the envy of every young man within thirty miles of boston it was no time to get involved in a as important as this would be i think i shall have to go to bed remarked with a wearied look i am still very tired with my voyage and you know i have a great deal of business to do to morrow the father though with a trace of disappointment in his countenance for he dearly loved the subject on which he had launched out the next day escaped the discussion he so much dreaded he was with members of his firm until evening and came home so late that his father had already retired the succeeding day he managed to get leave of absence with some business for the concern in new york as an excuse and hastened to to pack a their marriage bond well business is of the first importance commented edward sadly as he heard the news you won t be gone more than a day or two i suppose there s time to run over and explain it to miss i hope you ve only spent a couple of hours with her your long absence yes said he would have the carriage stop there on the way to the train he would return from the metropolis as soon as his affairs there would let him of course then fearing to talk too long he bade his father a hasty farewell and entered the cab which had been summoned his interview with the ladies was even they accepted his statement about the urgent and sudden business call without arriving in new york he went first to the but there were no letters for him there he drove next to the hotel he had intended to occupy and found that no lady or other person had called to inquire for him or to leave any message he received both of these pieces cf information with for his nerves had recovered something of their natural strength and be he had not allowed himself to expect anything different there was no danger that he would this time or require the services of a physician although his regard for margaret rivers had suffered no he next sought out the services of a and arranged for two of their best men these never have any other kind to search the city for the missing one he told them her correct name gave the best description he could of her and detailed the manner in which she had him there was no need to hint at the relations he had sustained to their marriage bond her but he did say that they had arrived from on the same steamer giving the name of the vessel and the date the commenced in a way by several hundred strange to say they found the one who had taken miss and mr to the hotel and had then at her request driven her to a boarding house returning to their office they found there this was on the second day and one of them went with him to the house the lady evidently wanted who had however given the name of was easily identified at the boarding house but she had remained only one night and the landlady had an impression that she had said something about leaving the city as he listened to these words mr felt a deep conviction that all the efforts he might put forth to find this girl would be wasted that fate had swept her with one gigantic wave out of his reach forever he went back to the paid his bill saying that he needed nothing more at present then he pulled himself together and went about the business matters which had served as an excuse for his visit to new york giving no indication to the gentlemen whom he met that a pressure calculated to drive one to insanity was weighing him down he returned to boston on the third day firmly convinced that he had lost his heart s love and that he would never find her in this world firmly convinced also that there was no consideration even the health of his father that could induce him to become a living lie in the person of brace s husband there was a conflict

friend of mine i he gave me a quick glance then maybe your about him he said and i can t run no risks i was a goin down in the country this ere to see a party as lives at  he s been a about a black he has the black but look here i said that s me he gave me a curious no offence you know nor he said but i should wish for some evidence as to that afore i part with a like this ere well i said here s one of my cards will that do for you he took it and it out with a pretence of great caution but i saw well enough that the old scoundrel suspected that if i had lost a dog at all it was not this particular dog ah he said as he put it in his pocket if i part with him to you i must be cleared of all risk i can t afford to get into trouble about no mistakes unless you likes to leave him for a day or two you must pay according you see i wanted to get the hateful business over as soon as possible i did not care what i paid  was worth all the expense i said i had no doubt myself as to the real of the animal but i would give him any sum in reason and would remove the dog at once and so we settled it i paid him an sum and came away with a a which i hoped to pass off at as the long lost i know it was wrong  it even came near dog stealing  but i was a desperate man i saw gradually slipping away from me i knew that nothing short of this could ever recall her i was sorely tempted i had gone far on the same road i the black already it was the old story of being hung for a sheep and so i fell surely some who read this will be generous enough to consider the peculiar state of the case and mingle a little pity with their contempt i was dining in town that evening and took my purchase home by a late train his was grave and intensely respectable he was not the animal to commit himself by any  he was gentle and too and in all respects an agreeable contrast in character to the original still it may have been the after dinner workings of conscience but i could not help that i saw a certain look in the creature s eyes as if he were aware that he was required to at a fraud and rather resented it if he would only be good enough to back me up fortunately however he was such a perfect of the outward that the risk of detection was really when i got him home i put s silver collar round his neck  myself on my in preserving it  and took him in to see my mother she accepted him as what he seemed without the slightest but this though it encouraged me to go on was not decisive the would have to encounter the scrutiny of those who knew every on the genuine animal s body nothing would have induced me to undergo such an ordeal as that of personally restoring him to the the black we gave him supper and tied him up on the lawn where he howled all night and buried bones the next morning i wrote a note to mrs expressing my pleasure at being able to restore the lost one and another to containing only the words will you believe now that i am sincere then i tied both round the s neck and dropped him over the wall into the colonel s garden just before i started to catch my train to town r p r f f i had an anxious walk home from the station that evening i went round by the longer way trembling the whole time lest i should meet any of the household to which i felt myself entirely unequal just then i could not rest until i knew whether my fraud had succeeded or if the to which i had my fate had betrayed me but my suspense was happily ended as soon as i entered my mother s room you can t think how delighted those poor were to see again she said at once and they said such charming things about you  particularly  quite affected she seemed poor child and they wanted you to go round and dine there and be thanked to night but at last i persuaded them to come to us instead and they re going to bring the dog to make friends oh and i met frank he s back from circuit again now so i asked him in too to meet them i drew a deep breath of relief i had played a the black desperate game  but i had won i could have wished to be sure that my mother had not thought of bringing in on that of all evenings  but i hoped that i could defy him after this the colonel and his people were the first to arrive he and his wife being so grateful that they made me very uncomfortable indeed met me with downcast eyes and the faintest possible blush but she said nothing just then five minutes afterwards when she and i were alone together in the where i had brought her on pretence of showing a new she laid her hand on my sleeve and whispered almost mr  can you ever forgive me for being so cruel and unjust to you and i replied that upon the whole i could we were not in that long but before we left it beautiful had consented	edith-wharton

to break the monotony among the letters received was one which seemed to worry thorn a great deal he told his sister hurriedly financial matters required his presence in and started immediately for that city he said however that he expected to return in a few days and kissed her at parting there was one person at the hotel w ho ht of a way to lessen the this van in whose mind still bitterly the statement that mr had asked to be his wife her resolution to have it out with him was a sugar princess warmly by mrs young affair was to her in one of those confidences that women love mrs young protested it was the most outrageous breach of hospitality she had ever heard of indeed she would give the fellow a piece of her mind if she was the injured mother she would not her words either she would tell him that after what had happened his room was better his company an opportunity came late in the afternoon when and olive had gone out for a stroll with ld s maid for through the village mr having been watched for carefully was detected in one of the and into mrs van s parlor like a fly into that of a spider having got him fairly the lady no time in giving him her opinion of what he had done my daughter begged me not to refer to the subject she said in closing a very warm but i feel it my duty to ask you to pursue your journey without us it will not be agreeable to travel with a man who could so far forget himself when miss van she will be able to select her husband from the highest circles i should have supposed you would realize that and save us this humiliation mr bowed with the never failing good manners for which he had always been conspicuous though his cheek burned at the speech i will certainly obey your request he said in a firm yoke but in justice to myself i ask you to listen to a sugar princess a statement which may in some you anger toward me may i proceed half turning from him mrs van remarked that he could say anything he pleased but he must understand in advance that it would not have slightest effect on her decision in the first place then he began my name is not but i am the eldest son and heir of lord of and descended on both my father and s side from old and highly connected families in due time i shall become not only a member of the british of lords but very wealthy i thought in the circumstances that i was justified in to the hand of a young lady whose ancestors have i believe been conspicuous in the history of their country mrs van told mrs young afterwards that she thought she should faint she in her dress pocket for her smelling but could not find them was there ever such a dreadful mistake i beg your pardon most sincerely my lord she as soon as she could find strength i am with confusion why has all this been concealed until now because he replied her i wanted to win your beautiful child in such a way that i fed she had accepted me for myself i thought the prejudice of her father against rank might be in time if he knew me first as a plain citizen i ami very sorry for what has happened although miss declined my proposal i had hoped that time a sugar princess might her to change her decision with your prejudice against me it is evident i can have no hope i will leave here tomorrow mrs van and can only trust that my explanation will lessen your severe opinion of my conduct mrs van hastened to get between her victim and the door indeed my lord you will do nothing of kind she exclaimed i beg you to forget all i have said and continue our companion and friend my lord i entreat you i shall never forgive if you do not remain a sugar princess it was his spirit the decision of in relation to his inheritance was never in any serious doubt his feelings toward his adopted uncle were so tender his hurt so deep that he could not bring himself to accept any part of the large fortune his friend had left there were many reasons why a tidy sum of money would have been very welcome to him just then and he thought these over with a fainting heart during long hours he passed alone in the hills above his position as an in the party with van nearly drove him to madness notwithstanding mr s kindness and the outward consideration with which he was treated by most of the others he that he was something lower than a gentleman something but little higher than a it was not he despised his position in itself but because the woman he madly loved had degraded him so far as to pity his sad plight in her presence he was at the extreme of mental misery the which compelled him to march like a in her train were becoming ah how different if instead of a paid companion lo a old it was thus he a sugar princess mr love joy in his distress he were a gentleman of fortune counted for what he believed himself to be as much money as was now offered him he might even to the agony of the trial but he never for a moment wavered from his rigid determination he would not assist in the disposition peter had made of his

chapter x ik jim said i to one morning as the type writer began to work perhaps yon can me on a point concerning which a great many people have questioned me recently has taken hold of yet you referred to it some time ago and ive been wondering ever since if it had become a with you has it laughed my visitor well i should rather say it had the fact is it has been a great boon to the country you remember my telling you of the projected revolution led by and and the others i do very well said i and i have the enchanted type writer been intending to ask yon how it came out oh everything s as fine and sweet as can be now rejoined somewhat and all of we are all quiet along the now all are buried in the general love of and every one of us high or low and is away in peace and happiness on the links why only six weeks ago was for cooking on a iron and yesterday the two went out to the links together and played a mixed and playing against and dear me really r i cried that must have been an interesting match it was and up to the very last it was and between em said and won it with one hole up and they got that on the put they d have the hole if s back hair hadn t loose and bitten her just as she was out in it is a remarkable game said i there is no sensation in the world quite equal to that which comes to a man s when he has hit the ball a solid and sees it sail off through the air towards the green along like a very bird true said but fm rather of the opinion that it s a safer game for shades than for you purely material persons i don t see why i answered it is easy to understand returned for instance with us there is no resistance when by a we come into unexpected contact with the ball take the experience of and solomon at the st s links week before last the s was on and simple were playing just ahead of solomon and solomon was driving in great form for the first time in his life he seemed able to keep his eye on the ball and the way he sent it flying through the air was a the enchanted type writer tion and simple had both had their second stroke and solomon drove off his ball sailed straight ahead like a from a flew in a bee line for struck him at the base of his brain on through and landed on the edge of the green mercy r i cried didn t it kill him r f course not retorted you can t kill a shade didn t know he d been hit but if that had happened to one of you material there d have been a sickening end to that there would indeed said it there isn t much fun in being hit by a i can testify to that because i have had the experience and i called to mind the day at st s when jo unconsciously with my material self the celebrated the demon driver from the links scotland made his mark that day if he never did before and i bear the i in evidence thereof even now although the incident took place two years ago when i did not know enough to keep out of the way of the player who plays so well that he thinks he has a perpetual right of way everywhere what kind of clubs do you use i asked oh very much the same kind that you do returned everybody experiments with new too just as you do old peter for instance always drives with his wooden leg and never uses anything else unless he gets a lie where he s got to his leg i roared with a laugh how on earth does he do that r he the small end of it into a square block shod like a explained up his ball goes back ten yards makes a run at it and the ball pretty nearly out of sight he can put with it too like a dream swinging it sideways l the enchanted type writer but he doesn t call that does he i cried what is it demanded well i should call it said not at all said not a bit of it he hasn t any foot on that leg and he has a club head with a shaft to it there isn t any rule which says that the shaft shall not look like an nine pin nor do any of the accepted authorities require that the club shall be by the arms i admit it s bad form the way he plays but as himself says he never did travel on his shape suppose he gets a lie i asked very much interested at the first news from of the famous old oh he does one of two things said he it out with his toe or goes back and plays two more plays a good game too he beat the colonel forty seven straight holes last wednesday and all has been talking about it ever since j in who is the colonel i asked innocently returned didn t yon ever hear of colonel of i replied but i always supposed was an imaginary opponent not a real one so he is said then you mean  i mean that beat him forty seven up said were there any witnesses i demanded for i had little faith in s regard for the eternal among which a card must be numbered if the game is to survive yes a hundred said there was only	catharine-maria-sedgwick
haunted and that he would not stay in her a day if he had any other place to go to indeed the fellow is honestly frightened and i had to give him the captain of the pole star and of this morning to steady him down he seemed quite indignant when i suggested that he had been having an extra glass the night before and i was obliged to him by keeping as grave a countenance as possible during his story which he certainly in a very straight forward and matter of fact way was on the bridge he said about four bells in the middle watch just when the night was at its darkest there was a bit of a moon but the clouds were blowing across it so that you couldn t see far from the ship john m the came aft from the head and reported a strange noise on the bow i went and we both heard it sometimes like a crying and sometimes like a in pain i ve been seventeen years to the country and i never heard seal old or young make a sound like that as we were standing there on the head the moon came out from behind a cloud and we both saw a sort of white figure moving across the ice field in the same direction that we had heard the cries we lost sight of it for a while but it came back on the port bow and we could just make it out like a shadow on the ice i sent a hand aft for the and m and i went down on to the pack thinking that maybe it might be a bear when we got on the ice i lost sight of m but i pushed on in the direction where i could still hear the cries i followed them for a mile or maybe more and then running round a i came right on to the top of it the captain of the pole star standing and waiting for me seemingly i don t know what it was it wasn t a bear any way it was tall and white and straight and if it wasn t a man nor a woman i ll stake my it was something worse i made for the ship as hard as i could run and precious glad i was to find myself aboard i signed articles to do my duty by the ship and on the ship i ll stay but you don t catch me on the ice again after that is his story given as far as i can in his own words i fancy what he saw must in spite of his denial have been a young bear erect upon its hind legs an attitude which they often assume when alarmed in the uncertain light this would bear a resemblance to a human figure especially to a man whose nerves were already somewhat shaken whatever it may have been the occurrence is unfortunate for it has produced a most unpleasant effect upon the crew their looks are more sullen than before and their discontent more open the double grievance of being from the fishing and of being detained in what they choose to call a haunted vessel may lead them to something rash even the who are the oldest and among them are joining in the general agitation apart from this absurd outbreak of superstition things are looking rather more cheerful the pack which was forming to the south of us has partly cleared away and water is so warm as to lead me to believe that we are lying in one of those branches of the gulf stream lo the captain of the pole star which run up between and there are numerous small and about the ship with abundance of so that there is every possibility of fish being sighted indeed one was seen blowing about dinner time but in such a position that it was impossible for the boats to follow it september a  had an interesting conversation with the chief mate mr upon the bridge it seems that our captain is as great an to the and even to the owners of the vessel as he has been to me mr tells me that when the ship is paid off upon returning from a voyage captain and is not seen again until the approach of another season when he walks quietly into the office of the company and asks whether his services will be required he has no friend in nor does any one pretend to be acquainted with his early history his position depends entirely upon his skill as a seaman and the name for courage and coolness which he had earned in the capacity of mate before being with a separate command the unanimous opinion seems to be that he is not a and that his name is an assumed one mr thinks that he has devoted himself to for the reason that it is the most dangerous occupation which he could select and that he courts death in every possible manner he mentioned several instances of this one of which is rather curious if true it seems that on one occasion he did captain of the pole star it not put in an appearance at the office and a substitute had to be selected in his place that was at the time of the last russian and war when he turned up again next spring he had a wound in the side of his neck which he used to endeavour to conceal with his whether the mate s that he had been engaged in the war is true or not i cannot say it was certainly a strange coincidence the wind is round in an direction but is still very slight i think the ice is lying closer than it did yesterday as far as the	edith-wharton
in all wide london upon that day a sweeter girl than as she sat in her grey dress with the london sun her brown curls with that glimmer a she handed back the ring and a graver expression passed over her face i feel as you said in your letter frank there is tragic in it it will be with me for ever all the future v ill arrange itself round that little ring are you afraid of it afraid her grey glove rested for an instant upon the back of his hand i couldn t be afraid of anything if you with me it is really extraordinary for by nature i am so easily frightened but if i were with you in a railway accident or anywhere it would be just the same you see i become for the time part of you as it were and you are brave enough for two i don t profess to be so brave as all that said frank i expect i have as many nerves as my neighbours s grey nodded up and down i know all about that said she you have such a false idea of me it makes me happy at the time and miserable afterwards for i feel such a rank you me to be a hero and a genius and all sorts of things while i know that i am about as ordinary a young fellow as walks the streets of london and no more worthy of you than  well than any one else is the two she laughed with shining eyes i like to hear you talk like that said she that is just what is so beautiful about you it is hopeless to prove that you are not a hero when your are themselves taken as a proof of heroism frank shrugged his shoulders i only hope you find me out gradually and not suddenly said he now we have all day and all london before us what shall we do i want you to choose i am quite happy whatever we do i am content to sit here with you until evening her idea of a happy holiday set them both laughing along said he we shall discuss it as we go the workman s family was still waiting and handed the child a shilling as she went out she was so happy herself that she wanted every one else to be happy also the people turned to look at her as she passed with the slight flush upon her cheeks and the light in her eyes she seemed the of youth and life and love one tall old gentleman started as he looked and watched her with a face until she disappeared some cheek had flushed and some eye had brightened at his a words once and sweet old days had for an instant lived again shall we liave a cab o frank we must learn to be economical let walk i can t and won t be to there now see what a bad influence i have upon yon most but we have not settled yet where we are to go to what does it matter if we are together there is a good match at the oval the against would you care to see that yes dear if you would and there are at all the theatres you would rather be in the open air all i want is that you should enjoy yourself never fear i shall do that well then first of all i vote that we go and have some lunch they started across the station yard and led the beautiful old stone cross among and the four the and the lounging there that lovely of he pious of a great king his beloved wife the two six hundred years ago said frank as they paused and looked up that old stone cross was completed with and knights around it to honour her whose memory was honoured by the king now the stand where the knights stood and the engines whistle where the but the old cross is the same as ever in the same old place it is a little thing of that sort which makes one the unbroken history of our country insisted upon hearing about queen and frank imparted the little that he knew as they walked out into the crowded strand she was edward the first s wife and a splendid woman it was she you remember who sucked the wound when he was with a poisoned dagger she died somewhere in the north and he had the body carried south to bury it in westminster abbey wherever it rested for a night he built a cross and so you have a line of crosses all down england to show where that sad journey was broken they had turned down and passed the big upon their black at the gate of the horse guards frank pointed to one of the windows of the old hall a you ve been a memorial of a queen of england said he that window ia the memorial of a why so frank i believe that it was through that the first passed out to the when his head was cut off it was the first time that the people had ever shown that they claimed authority over their king poor fellow said he was so handsome and such a good husband and father it is the good kings who may be the dangerous ones o frank if a king thinks only of pleasure then he does not interfere with matters of state but if he is conscientious he tries to do what he to be his duty and so he causes trouble look at for example he was a very good man and yet he caused a civil war george the third was a most character but his stupidity lost us america and nearly lost us	edith-wharton
to  so you re not in the army my boy he asked abruptly i m a foreigner the young man answered the captain seemed only half pleased with this reason he winked and smiled was pleasanter company than cannon then seeing him smile added  i m a foreigner but i can put a bullet into an apple at five hundred  see my gun s there behind you by la it may be of use to you the captain replied simply had come up trembling a little and without the people there took both the hands she held out to him and pressed them in his as if to take her under his protection the captain smiled again il added not a word he remained sitting his sword between his leg his eyes looking at as if in a dream it was already two o clock it was growing very hot there was a dead silence in the court yard the sheds the soldiers had fallen to eating their soup not a sound came from the village in which the people had their houses doors and windows a dog left alone in the road was howling from the neighboring woods and meadows motionless in the heat came a far off voice long sustained made up of every separate breath of air a was singing then the silence spread itself over the country also and in this air a shot suddenly burst forth the captain sprang up quickly the soldiers dropped their plates of soup still half full in a few seconds every man was at his post for the fight the mill was occupied from top to bottom yet the captain who had gone out upon the road could make out nothing to the right and left the road stretched out empty and all white a second shot was heard and still nothing not a shadow but on turning round he over towards between two trees a light of smoke away like the wood was still profoundly quiet the have taken to the forest he muttered they know we are here then the firing kept up harder and harder between the french soldiers stationed round the mill and the hidden behind the trees the bullets whistled across the without any loss on one side or the other the shots were irregular coming from every bush and all you saw was still the little clouds of smoke gently away by the wind this lasted for nearly two hours the officer a tune as if indifferent and who had stayed in the court yard raised themselves up on and looked over the wall they were particularly interested in watching a little soldier stationed on the brink of the behind the of an old boat he was flat on his belly watched his chance fired by  his shot then let himself slide down into a ditch a little behind him to his rifle and his movements were so droll so cunning so that it made one smile to see him he must have the head of some for he got up quickly and brought his piece to his shoulder but before he fired he gave a cry turned over upon himself and rolled into the ditch where his legs out with the momentary jerk of those of a chicken with its neck wrung the little soldier had received a bullet full in the breast he was the first man killed instinctively seized hold of s hand and squeezed it with a nervous grip don t stay there said the captain the bullets reach here as he spoke a little sharp stroke was heard in the old elm and a branch fell in through the air but the young people did not stir there by anxiety at the sight on the outskirts of the wood a came out suddenly from behind a tree as from a side scene beating the air with his arms and tumbling over backwards and then nothing stirred the two dead men seemed to sleep in the dazzling sunshine you saw no one in the landscape even the crack of the shots stopped only the kept up its silver toned whispering old looked at the captain in surprise as if to ask if it were over here it comes the latter muttered look out don t stay there he had not finished speaking when there came a terrific it was as if the great elm were down a cloud of leaves whirled about them luckily the had fired too high dragged almost carried away while old followed them crying out  go down to the little cellar the walls are solid but they did not mind him they went into the great hall where ten soldiers or so were waiting in silence with shutters closed peeping through the cracks the captain had stayed alone in the court yard crouched down behind the little wall while the furious continued the soldiers he had stationed outside yielded ground only foot by foot yet they came in one by one crawling on their faces when the enemy had them from their hiding places their orders were to by  mile gain time not to show themselves so that the might not know what numbers they had before them another hour went by and as a came up saying that there were only two or three men left outside the officer looked at his watch muttering  half after two come we must hold out four hours he had the gate of the court yard shut and all preparations were made for an energetic resistance as the were on the other side of the an immediate assault was not to be feared to be sure there was a bridge a little over a mile off but they doubtless did not know of its existence and it was hardly probable that they would try to ford the river so the officer merely	edith-wharton

strike against the that communicate with the bells for half an hour on sunday they arc played by hand as at the praise bestowed upon the seemed to the students to be well there is nothing touching and beautiful than the music of these bells c and or the boys could not help taking in the inspiration they imparted and when it that mr the professor of had a copy of in his pocket they almost insisted that the poems relating to the scene should be read they gathered around him the circle closely by the men women and children of the dull old town who had apparently been roused their by tjie advent of the young americans in his deep bass tones he read the first in the town of in the quaint old city as the evening shades descended low and loud and sweetly blended and changing like a poet s rang the beautiful wild from the in the market of the ancient town of the students listened with almost breathless interest till the last line of the was read there was something so grand and beautiful in the poem itself as the images of the past are brought up  i beheld the splendid that adorned those days of old stately like queens attended knights who bore the of gold  and something in the association of the living lines with the real of before them that the impression was one to be remembered for years after a hasty walk through a couple of the ancient streets of the city the students returned to the railroad station and the train started for a ride of about two hours from it v as half past nine when they arrived at the capital of the party were greeted by mr who had been sent direct from to make arrangements for their stay over night captain his officers and crew were sent to the hotel royal in the it was a small hotel but very nice and comfortable mr the proprietor spoke english but he appeared to be tire only person in the house who could do so he was very polite and attentive to the students and spoke familiarly and pleasantly to them about my hotel mr himself had a faculty for a hotel and precisely what tired s wanted when they came in late in the evening and he had ordered in addition to the im complete the and de the boys were as hungry as wolves and the solid part of the entertainment was very inviting each dish of was covered over with nicely potatoes in a few moments there was hardly a of the feast remaining on the table the america s ship s company were at the hotel de i and the hotel de so that the party was separated and paul was rather glad of it because there were some belonging to the ship who were not influenced by the motives which prevailed in the he could control his crew even without the aid of mr who with several of the professors also lodged at the royal c le and or they were a jolly party at the supper table and as none of the spoke a word of english was a great deal of fun made in giving their orders but everybody was remarkably good natured including the themselves waiter called who as a general rule was not guilty of knowing much about any of his studies bring me the the servant took no notice of him call him a on said i shouted replied the man bring me the you might as well call for a canada laughed who was one of the best french scholars in the i want butter i have eaten up all the and all the de and now i want some bread and butter these fellows don t understand their own language  m du added om exclaimed the waiter producing the required article that s the idea replied that man s improving but this is so fresh i can t eat it i want some salt ca i for it then laughed i will here s a go good roared if we had a saddle of mutton for supper i should suppose you would want what you called for i want the salt in holland and i you did and that s the reason why you called for a i didn t call for any i said precisely so and that is a what shall i say well i knew there was a sell about it somewhere precisely but you were sold i advise you not to make any long speeches french you may bet your life i shall not replied just mention the thing you want in one word then you won t a of s intellect by it with ideas  added acting this excellent advice the waiter brought the and nobody was sold this time i think i shall pick tip the french language in time added encouraged by his success perhaps you will but the h royal will have to dust before that happy event occurs there was any quantity of made at the table and some of the students had nearly choked themselves to death with laughing at them and at the blank looks of the when spoken to in a tongue which mr declared sounded more like low dutch than decent french mr laughed too and intimated that my hotel had never been so lively before what now captain said mr when tlie supper and the had ended  i i h le os and or my officers aud crew wish

that there was no rest for me that night nor for we went to the main gate of the city before nightfall with a hope in our minds based upon that vague prophecy of s voices which seemed to promise a rescue by mark twain force at the last moment the immense news had flown swiftly far and wide that at last of arc was condemned and would be and burned alive on the morrow and so crowds of people were flowing in at the gate and other crowds were being refused admission by the these being people who brought doubtful passes or none at all we these crowds eagerly but there was nothing about them to indicate that they were our old in disguise and certainly there were no familiar faces among them and so when the gate was closed at last we turned away grieved and more disappointed than we cared to admit either in speech or thought the streets were tides of excited men it was difficult to make one s way toward midnight our tramp brought us to the neighborhood of the beautiful church of st and there all was bustle and work the square was a wilderness of and people and through a guarded passage dividing the pack were and and disappearing with them through the gate of the churchyard we asked what was going forward the answer was and the stake don t you know that the french witch is to be burned in the morning then we went away we had no heart for that place at dawn we were at the city gate again this time with a hope which our wearied bodies and minds into a large probability we had heard a report that the of with all recollections of of arc his was coming to witness the burning our desire by our imagination turned those nine hundred into s old and their into la hire or the or d and we watched them file in the multitude respectfully dividing and while they passed with our hearts in our throats and our eyes swimming with tears of joy and pride and exultation and we tried to catch glimpses of the faces under the and were prepared to give signal to any recognized face that we were s men and ready and eager to kill and be killed in the good cause how foolish we were but we were you know and youth all things all things n  chapter xx in the morning i was at my post it was on a platform raised the height of a man in the churchyard under the of st on this same platform was a crowd of priests and important citizens and several lawyers abreast it with a small space between was another and larger platform handsomely against sun and rain and richly also it was furnished with comfortable chairs and with two which were more than the others and raised above the general level one of these two was occupied by a prince of the royal blood of england his eminence the cardinal of the other by bishop of in the rest of the chairs sat three the vice eight and the sixty two and lawyers who had sat as s judges in her late trials twenty steps in front of the was another  a table of stone built up in retreating courses thus forming steps out of this rose that thing the stake about the stake bundles of and were piled on the at the base of the stood three crimson figures the and his at their feet lay what had been a goodly heap of recollections of of arc but was now a nest of ruddy coals a foot or two from this was a supply of wood and into a pile shoulder high and containing as much as six loads think of that we seem so delicately made so so yet it is easier to reduce a granite statue to ashes than it is to do that with a man s body the sight of the stake sent physical pains down the nerves of my body and yet turn as i would my eyes would keep coming back to it such fascination has the and the terrible for us the space occupied by the and the stake was kept open by a wall of english standing elbow to elbow erect and figures fine and in their polished steel while from behind them on every hand stretched far away a level plain of heads and there was no window and no within our view distant but was black with patches and masses of people but there was no noise no stir it was as if the world was dead the of this silence and solemnity was deepened by a leaden twilight for the sky was hidden by a pall of low hanging storm clouds and above the remote horizon faint of heat lightning played and now and then one caught the dull and of distant thunder at last the stillness was broken beyond the square rose an indistinct but familiar  mark twain crisp phrases of command next i saw plain of heads dividing and the steady swing of a marching host was between my heart leaped for a moment was it la hire and his no  that was not their gait no it was the prisoner and her escort it was of arc under guard that was coming my spirits sank as low as they had been before weak as she was they made her walk they would increase her weakness all they could the distance was not great  it was but a few hundred yards  but short as it was it was a heavy tax upon one who had been lying chained in one spot for months and whose feet had lost their powers from yes and for a year had known only the cool	helen-mathers

remarked do you know anything of eastern languages smith nothing at all not a word the answer seemed to lift a weight from the s mind by the way he continued how long was it from the time that you ran down until i came to my senses not long some four or five minutes i thought it could not be very long said he drawing a long breath but what a strange thing is i there is no to it i could not tell from my own sensations if it were seconds or weeks now that gentleman on the table was packed up in the days of the some forty centuries ago and yet if he could find his tongue he would tell us that this lapse of time hm i bat a closing of the eyes and a of them he is a singularly fine smith stepped over to the table and looked down with a professional eye at the black and twisted form in front of him the features though horribly were perfect and two little nut like eyes still in the depths of the black hollow the skin was drawn tightly from bone to bone and a tan lot ih wrap of black coarse fell over the ears two thin teeth like those of a rat the lower lip in its crouching position with bent joints and head there was a suggestion of energy about the horrid thing which made smith s rise the gaunt ribs with their like covering were exposed and the sunken leaden with the long where the had left his mark but the lower limbs were round with coarse yellow a number of little like pieces of and of were sprinkled over the body and lay scattered on the inside of the case i don t know his name said passing his hand over the head you see the outer with the is missing lot is all the title he has now you see it printed his case that was his number in the at i picked him up he has been a very pretty sort of fellow in his day remarked smith e has been a giant his is six feet seven in length and that would be a giant over there for they were never a very robust race feel these great knotted bones too he would be a nasty fellow to tackle perhaps these very hands helped to build the stones into the suggested round the red lamp house lee looking down with in his eyes at the crooked no fear this fellow has been in and looked after in the most approved style they did not serve in that fashion salt or was enough for them it has been calculated that this sort of thing cost about seven hundred and thirty pounds in our money our friend was a noble at the least what do you make of that small inscription near his feet smith i told you that i know no eastern tongue ah so you did it is the name of the i take it a very conscientious he must have been i wonder how many modem works will survive four thousand years he kept on speaking lightly and rapidly but it was evident to smith that he was still with fear his hands shook his lower lip trembled and look where he would his eye always came sliding round to his companion through all his fear however there was a suspicion of triumph in his tone and manner his eye shone and his footstep as he paced the room was brisk and he gave the impression of a man who has gone through an ordeal the marks of which he still bears upon him but which has helped him to his end lot no you re not going yet he cried as smith rose from the sofa at the prospect of solitude his fears seemed to crowd back upon him and he stretched out a hand to detain him yes i must go i have my work to do you are all right now i think that with your nervous system you should take up some less morbid study oh i am not nervous as a rule and i have before you fainted last time observed lee ah yes so i did well i must have a nerve or a course of you are not going lee do whatever you wish ned then i ll come down with you and have a shake down on your sofa good night smith i am so sorry to have disturbed you with my foolishness they shook hands and as the medical student stumbled up the and irregular stair he heard a key turn in a door and the steps of his two new acquaintances as they descended to th lower floor in this strange way began the acquaintance between edward and bound the red lamp smith an which the latter at least had no desire to further however appeared to have taken a fancy to his neighbour and made his advances in such a way that he could hardly be without absolute twice he called to thank smith for his assistance and many times afterwards he looked in with books ers and such other as two bachelor neighbours can offer each other he was as smith soon found a man of wide reading with catholic tastes and an extraordinary memory his manner too was so pleasing and that one came after a time to overlook his appearance for a and wearied man he was no unpleasant companion and smith found himself after a time looking forward to his visits and even returning them clever as he undoubtedly was however the medical student seemed to detect a dash of insanity in the man he broke out at times into a high style of talk which was in contrast with the simplicity of his life it is a wonderful thing	edith-wharton
the sinister influence of the smile he could not wholly overcome mr took the letter and read the signature it was certainly charles with a flourish extensive enough for any great man from the letter he at the fat professor who being always good was so now he could get rid pf a and or lingering suspicion that his associate was imposing upon him it was a great misfortune that his own knowledge of french was so limited and if it had not been so late he would have gone on board of the ship to ask professor to the to him instead of doing this he went to the record book of the and ascertained that was marked among the highest in french now was a very polite and respectful student and mr had a greater regard for him than for most of his companions finding this promising young man on deck he invited him to the sacred of the professor s state room was even more polite and obliging than usual at the request of his present host who did not offer any explanations he wrote out a translation of the important letter mr thanked him and he retired there was no material between the of mr and and the learned professor congratulated himself upon the distinction he had attained his fame as a had preceded him across the ocean the king s chief minister his acquaintance this was the homage which greatness paid to learning and mr was willing to believe that it was a deserved he soon worked himself into a flutter of excitement in anticipation of being taken by the hand by the king s chief minister and he slept but little during the night so absorbed was he in the contemplation of the distinguished honor which awaited him professor is going to court said young in holy and and can lo his o d friend the when they met on after supper to court whom laughed he has had an invitation to go to court to see the big i translated a letter for him from the minister of foreign affairs and i suppose he s about the biggest in the added you won t be able to touch him with a ten foot pole after that we shall get along very well him if we only do our duty said paul the fellows are not very fond of him and if he puts on any more airs they won t be able to it  why what s the matter ben ed paul anxiously for generally everything had gone on so well on board of the that he dreaded any trouble o nothing nothing laughed only the fellows don t like him ben there s something up said paul earnestly if the fellows think anything at all of me they won t make any trouble if i don t complain of mr they needn t i don t find any fault with him myself protested ben i don t like him but i have always got along veiy well with him what did you mean by mentioning this matter to me ben asked paul nothing only i shouldn t be sm if the fellows were to haze the venerable a little in a quiet way they are all down upon him i am sorry for that i hope all the fellows will and or do their duty and not get into any replied paul very seriously i am sorry but i can t say that i blame them i shall blame them if they commit any act of said the captain decidedly i hope you will say what you can forward to keep the fellows from doing anything that would hint mr s feelings what can i do the old doesn t treat the students like gentlemen and if he so what can you expect of the fellows he is cross and have they just found it out no but they were willing to bear it rather than make any trouble on board after what he did last saturday they arc not disposed to be so and i can t blame them much what happened last saturday was between mr and me and the students needn t trouble themselves about that but the fellows like you first rate even t ie worst ones we have on board and there are some pretty hard boys here laughed if they like me tliey will not get up a row i will take care tbat all of them know just how feel said concluding to end the conversation at this point for the subject of these remarks had just come on deck the learned gentleman appeared to carry his head even higher and to be mere dignified stiff and reserved than usual with au invitation in his pocket young america in holland and to visit the greatest in lie felt like a very exalted personage for not even mr had been so highly favored mr was puffed up and swelled out by the honor the great man had done him and as he walked up and down the deck the students might have known by his air if they had not been told of the fact that greatness had suddenly been thrust upon him it presently occurred to him that the principal had not been informed of the distinguished consideration in which the government of regarded the s senior it was important that he should know it for the fact would certainly him in the estimation of the principal and cause him to regret that in the recent difficulty he had not more fully sustained his notable professor besides he wished to make some arrangements which would permit him to visit the de la nation and to dine with the minister if he should be invited as he had no doubt he

majesty remarked that several very unpleasant things might occur and earl of her majesty was frightened to death when she saw the document and felt as if unawares they must have up against the british trouble constitution but explained that it was only a little legal which meant that there might be some trouble later well at any rate said frank it means that in eight days it will all be over laughed heartily at the remark it means said he that in eight days we must promise that at some future date we will begin to make preparations for something to happen in the future that is about the meaning of it all you can do now is to be perfectly philosophic and leave the rest to me but how is a man with a capital of fifty i going to be philosophic when he is fighting an opponent whose as a certain near told him every morning exceeded three millions of pounds he treated it lightly to and she to him but each suffered horribly and each was well aware of the other s real feelings sometimes there was a lull and they could almost believe that the whole thing was over and then the old machine gave a and the rusty wheels took one more turn and they both felt the horrid thing which held them first of all they had to enter appearances which meant that they would dispute the action then the other side had to make an a their claim then a master had to pronounce whether the action be treated or whether he would listen to what they had to say about it he decided to listen to what was to he said then side claimed to the other s discovery they called it as if the documents were concealed and they had to hunt for them stealthily with then each made remarks about the other s documents and claimed to see the remarks made then the lawyers of the company made a statement of their claim and when she read it burst into tears and said that it was all over and they must make the best of it and she should never forgive herself for that dew dress in the spring and then frank s lawyer drew up a defence and when frank heard it he said why what a silly business it seems they have not got a leg to stand upon and so after all these and the two parties did actually begin to show signs of coming to a hearing after ail and a day was fixed for the trial by a coincidence it was frank s birthday there a a good omen i cried the first herald of the conflict was a person who thrust a paper into frank s hand as he emerged from the in the trouble morning it was another letter from her majesty in which sub her majesty has not a gracious way of putting things in these documents mr frank had to attend at the royal courts of justice strand at the of the queen s bench division of our high court of justice to give evidence on behalf of the company this seemed to frank to be a most and stroke but simply laughed that is mere bluff said he it makes me think that they are they want to frighten you they did said frank two can play at that game we must keep a bold front what do you mean to do to all their crowd capital cried frank so a clerk was sent across to the office with a whole bundle of and served them liberally out and in two days time was the day of battle a rescue as the day fixed for the hearing drew near lived with them by day and slept with them by night its dark shadow covered their lives and they moved in the gloom ol its presence ii the trial went against them and in his most hopeful moods did not disguise from them that it might they would have to pay the double costs aa well as the original claim ah that they possessed would not cover it on the other hand if they won this rich company might carry the matter to a higher appeal court and so involve them in a fresh succession of anxieties and expenses do what they would there was always danger said little and he slept little also one night just before the trial the of the society came down to he had managed the case all through for the his visit was a sort of we are still ready to pay our own law costs said he if you will allow the original claim a rescue i can t do that said frank the costs are up at a furious rate and some one will have to pay them i hope that it will be you well don t say afterwards that i did not warn you my dear i assure you that you are being and that you have not really got a leg to stand upon that s what the trial is about said frank he kept a bold face to the enemy but after s departure saw that his confidence was greatly shaken he seemed very sure of their case said he he would not speak like that if he did not know but took quite another view if they know that they can recover their money in court why should they send mr down in this way he is such a good chap  he wants to save us expense was less trusting he is doing the best for his own side said she it is his duty and we can t blame him but if he thought it best to get behind his own lawyers and come down here then he must have some doubts about going into	edith-wharton

to go there at once so as to catch the inmates off their guard surrounded by a glittering staff of officers he descended the steps towards the water and springing to his feet in apparent surprise went forward to receive him was a tall slim man not in face though it was utterly spoiled by a expression which at once betrayed the of his nature he affected considerable state though but the president of the republic and with the innate love of finery possessed by all appeared dressed in a rich green uniform with gold lace his officers were also dressed in london in uniform and there was plenty of of swords flashing of and of feathers to add to the of the whole affair the president had his breast covered with orders some bestowed on him by the late king before he had proved a traitor the sight of these would have the princess beyond all the bounds of endurance but she was far distant watching these disguised in feathers from an upper window of the villa why did not your let us know you were

thus talking to the president his officers were with and the major a number of servants brought down of which all partook and little by little the suspicions of began to disappear it is only a pleasure party he thought the faces of those around they not deceive me for once was wrong and afterwards when it was too late he often bitterly regretted that he had been so easily by the affected

pleasant closing of his visit to the city if he had swallowed a lake of wine and didn t know how to carry it off he surely ought to blame some one beside his when he had pulled himself together a little he would be sorry for the things he had said refused to be it was a question at one time whether he would not vent his rage in something more substantial than words as he took the train he felt that he would not care if it ran off the track and broke his body into fragments he had disgraced himself beyond repair he had disgraced his wife that innocent pure girl whose name had been mentioned

with his business did not like to contemplate a strange woman there everything to suit her own tastes and his employer had denied the suggestion of so vehemently on a previous occasion that he never

it is not mrs that i am thinking of marrying then you are a bigger fool than i took you to be to marry her would prove you short of common sense but to take another woman would show that you had become completely the man of wealth listened with no sign of he was used to this blunt man and expected nothing less from him thanks he responded with polite irony and what would you call me if i were to tell you that the woman i mean to wed is her daughter oh i know some things at this remark the slight control which had retained of his temper gave way entirely a villain he cried s manner changed

to save him from the who on this innocent li several cases he had opened train s eyes at the cost of with those who lost by the opening but george was well able to hold his own and none could say that he by the trust and confidence which in him to all suspicion of thi the yellow he had refused to become train s secretary and companion at an excellent salary was poor and wanted that salary but he valued his independence and so preferred to fight for his own hand however he continued his services to as a kind of ui official now that train came to think of it was rather a mysterious person he lived by writing articles for the papers and was always well dressed his rooms were in and he seemed to know many people whom he did not cultivate train would have given his ears to enter the houses at which was a welcome guest but for the most part george preferred to live alone with his pipe and his books he was writing a novel and hoped to make a successful career as a literary man but as he was barely thirty years of age and had been settled only five years in london his scheme of life was rather in he appeared to have some secret trouble but what it was train never knew as was a particularly man why he should propose to be frank on this especial night could not understand after supper he put the question to him well said without moving or taking his eyes from the fire it s this way train i know you are a kind hearted man and although you talk very freely about your own affairs yet i know you can keep the secret of a friend you can depend upon that anything you tell me will never be repeated nodded his thanks also he continued i wish you to lend me three hundred pounds a thousand if you will three hundred will be i ll repay you when i come into my property s story train opened his eyes are you coming into money he asked that i can t say it all depends do you know why i suggested this house to you he asked suddenly to help me in my literary work that was one reason certainly but i had another and more selfish one connected  sat up to finish the sentence  connected with mrs he said quietly this remark was so unexpected that did not know what to say for the moment i thought you did not know her he gasped out nor do l does she know you not as george or as i am now what do you mean train was more puzzled than ever it s a long story i don t know that i can tell you the whole train looked annoyed trust me all in all or not at all finished quite so he paused and drew hard at his pipe since i want money i must trust you is it only for that reason that you consider me worthy of your confidence asked much george leaned forward and patted him on the knee no old man i wish you to help me also in what way with ward replied george looking closely at his pipe was she in your mind to night when that old maid was telling the cards asked train sitting up with a look of interest nodded but i do not wish you to mention her name that was why the yellow i know i was foolish well she s a pretty girl and as good as she is pretty which is said considering the fashionable mother she has train smiled mrs ward is certainly a leader of fashion and as heartless as any woman i know observed he glanced affectionately at the yellow gave me this to night did you see her before you came here yes i went to afternoon tea we  examined his pipe again  we understand one another he said sprang to his feet my dear chap i congratulate you thanks but it s too early for as yet mrs ward wants her daughter to make a good marriage george will not be the husband of her choice but lord does she want her daughter to marry that old thing you don t understand i mean that if i become lord when the old man dies mrs ward will consent train sat down helplessly and stared i don t understand he said i ll put the thing in a explained lord is my grandfather your  but he never lived here no the grandfather who lived here and with whom i stayed was my mother s father he was called is my father s father now do you understand not quite how can you become lord when he has a  that young walter walter is the son of my father s brother s story and my father was the elder and the heir to the title then if lord dies you become exactly but the is that i have to establish my birth jumped up and clutched his hair here s a mystery he said staring at his friend what does it all mean sit down and fu teu you resumed his seat and glanced at the clock we have a quarter of an hour he said but i think we ll defy mrs and sit up this night no said hastily we may as well do what she wants i wish to her she is the only person who can help to prove my mother s marriage i thought there was something queer about her who was she my mother s maid but i had better tell you from the beginning train sat down and produced a go on he said no wait i want to know before	mark-twain

enough to call the next day at the royal john hotel in miss ended by stating that she had a particular desire to converse with mr and hoped that he would not fail to keep the appointment wondering greatly how the lady  who was no doubt the referred to by mrs  had obtained his address and why she desired to see him so particularly out of sheer curiosity obeyed the summons next day at four o clock  the appointed hour  he presented himself as requested and on giving his name was shown immediately into the presence of his correspondent who occupied a small private sitting room when miss rose to greet him was amazed to see how beautiful and stately she was with dark hair and eyes oval face and firm mouth majestic figure and imperial gait she moved towards him an apparent a greater contrast to mrs than her can scarcely be imagined the one was a frivolous fairy the other a dignified and reserved woman she also was arrayed in black garments but these were made in the manner and showed none of the of woe such as had mrs the silent house s elaborate costume the look of sorrow on the face of was in keeping with her mourning apparel and she welcomed with a subdued courtesy which him greatly in her favour quick in his likes and the young man was as drawn towards this beautiful sad woman as formerly he had been by the feigned grief and glances of silly mrs i am much obliged to you for calling mr said miss in a deep voice rather melancholy in its tone no doubt you wondered how i obtained your address it did strike me as peculiar i confess said taking a chair to which she pointed but on considering the matter i fancied that mrs had mrs echoed in a tone of contempt no i have not seen mrs since i returned a week ago to london i got your address from the who examined into the death of my most unhappy father you have seen link yes and i know all that link could tell me he mentioned your name frequently in his narrative and gave me to understand that on two occasions you had spoken with my father therefore i asked him to give me your address so that i might speak with you personally on the matter i am quite at your service miss i sup the silent house pose you wish to all that i know of the tragedy i wish for more than that mr said quietly i wish you to help me in hunting down the of my father do you intend to the case certainly but i did not know that the case  as you call it  had been closed i have come home from especially to devote myself to this matter i should have been in london long ago but that out in i was with some friends in a part of the country where it is difficult to get letters as soon as mrs s letter about the terrible end of my father came to hand i arranged my affairs and left at once for england since my arrival i have seen mr our family lawyer and mr link the they have told me all they know and now i wish to hear what you have to say i am afraid i cannot help you miss said ah you refuse to help me oh i shall only be too glad to do what i can protested shocked that she should think him so hard hearted but i know of nothing likely to solve the mystery both myself and link have done our best to discover the truth but without success well mr said after a pause they often say that a woman s wit can do more than a man s logic so you and i must put our heads the silent house together and discover the guilty person have you no suspicion no i have no suspicion replied frankly have you i have i suspect  a lady mrs yes how do you know i meant her because at one time i suspected her myself you suspected rightly replied i believe that mrs killed her husband chapter ix a marriage that was a failure did not reply at once to the accusation by at mrs as he was too astonished at her vehemence to find his voice readily when he did speak it was to argue on the side of the pretty widow i think you must be mistaken he said at length but mr you declared that you suspected her yourself at one time but not now replied because at the time of the murder mrs was keeping christmas in like when rome was burning retorted sharply but you mistake my meaning i do not say that mrs committed the crime personally but she inspired and guided the and who is the in your opinion count an italian as you may guess from the name now that is strange cried with some the silent house excitement for from the nature of the wound i believe that your father was by an italian said with satisfaction that the accusation i bring against and again continued hardly listening to what she was saying when i mentioned my suspicion about the in the hearing of mrs she fainted which showed that her guilty conscience pricked her oh i am sure of it mr my and the count are the our evidence as yet is only said cautiously we must not jump to conclusions at present i am completely in the dark regarding this foreigner i can you but it is a long story the longer the better said thinking he could hear speak and watch her face for hours

as a next move this small secret court of holy did a thing so base that even at this day in my old age it is hard to speak of it with patience in the beginning of her commerce with her voices there at the child solemnly devoted her life to god her pure body and her pure soul to his service you will remember that her parents tried to stop her from going to the wars by her to the court at to compel her to make a marriage which she had never promised to make  a marriage with our poor good windy big hard fighting and most dear and lamented comrade the standard bearer who fell in honorable battle and sleeps in god these sixty years peace to his ashes and you will remember how sixteen years old stood up in that venerable court and conducted her case all by herself and tore the poor s case to rags and blew it away with a breath and how the astonished old judge on the bench spoke of her as this child you remember all that then think what i felt to see these false priests here in the wherein  io by of arc had fought a fourth lone fight in three years deliberately twist that matter entirely around and try to make out that the into court and pretended that he had promised to marry her and was bent on making him do it certainly there was no that those people were ashamed to stoop to in their hunt for that girl s life what they wanted to show was this  that she had committed the sin of from her vow and trying to it detailed the true history of the case but lost her temper as she went along and finished with some words for which he remembers yet whether he is himself in the world he belongs in or has his way into the other the rest of this day and part of the next the court labored upon the old theme  the male attire it was shabby work for those grave men to be engaged in for they well knew one of s reasons for clinging to the male dress was that soldiers of the guard were always present in her room whether she was asleep or awake and that the male dress was a better protection for her modesty than the other the court knew that one of s purposes had been the of the duke of and they were curious to know how she had intended to manage it her plan was business like and her statement of it as simple and straightforward by of arc i would have taken english prisoners enough in france for his and failing that i would have invaded england and brought him out by force that was just her way if a thing was to be it was love first and hammer and to follow but no between she added with a little sigh  if i had had my freedom three years i would have delivered him have you the permission of your voices to break out of prison whenever you can   i have asked their leave several times but they have not given it i think it is as i have said she expected the of death and within the prison walls before the three months should  would you escape if you saw the doors open she spoke up frankly and said yes  for i should see in that the permission of our lord god helps who help themselves the proverb says but except i thought i had permission i would not go now then at this point something occurred which me every time i think of it  and it struck me so at the time  that for a moment at least her hopes wandered to the king and put into her mind the same notion about her which and i had settled upon  a rescue by her old soldiers i think the idea of the rescue did by of arc occur to her but only as a passing thought and that it quickly passed away some remark of the bishop of moved her to remind him once more that he was an unfair judge and had no right to there and that he was putting himself in great danger  what danger he asked i do not know st has promised me help but i do not know the form of it i do not know whether i am to be delivered from this prison or whether when you send me to the there will happen a trouble by which i shall be set free without much thought as to this matter i am of the opinion that it may be one or the other after a pause she added these words memorable forever  words whose meaning she may have misunderstood as to that we can never know words which she may have rightly understood as to that also we can never know but words whose mystery fell away from them many a year ago and revealed their real meaning to all the world but what my voices have said is that i shall be delivered by a great victory she paused my heart was beating fast for to me that great victory meant the sudden bursting in of our old soldiers with war cry and clash of steel at the last moment and the carrying off of of arc in triumph but oh that thought had such a short life for now she raised her head and finished with those solemn words which men still so often quote and by of arc dwell words which filled me fear ihey sounded so like a and always they say submit to whatever comes do not fat your from it you will ascend into	helen-mathers

it said the colonel left eh well i thought myself it was the right my heart almost stopped with terror  i had altogether forgotten that i hastened to set the point at rest oh it was the left i said positively i know it because i remember so particularly thinking how odd it was that it should h the left ear and not the right i told myself this should be positively my last lie why odd asked frank with his most offensive manner my dear fellow i can t tell you i said impatiently every thing seems odd when you come to think at all about it said later on will you tell aunt mary and mr and  and me how it was you came to find mr is quite anxious to hear all about it i could not very well refuse i sat down and told the story all my own way i painted perhaps rather bigger and than life and the black described an exciting scene in which i recognised by his collar in the streets and claimed and bore him off then and there in spite of all opposition i had the pleasure of seeing grinding his teeth with envy as i went on and feeling s soft slender hand glide silently into mine as i told my tale in the twilight all at once just as i reached the climax we heard the barking furiously at the hedge which separated my garden from the road there s a foreign looking man staring over the hedge said always foreigners there certainly was a man there and though i had no reason for it then somehow my heart died within me at the sight of him don t be alarmed sir cried the colonel the dog won t bite you unless there s a hole in the hedge anywhere the stranger took off his small straw hat with a sweep ah i am not afraid he said and his accent proclaimed him a frenchman he is not at me may i ask is it to speak i felt i most deal with this person alone for i feared the worst and asking them to excuse me i went to the hedge and faced the frenchman with the frightful calm of despair he was a short stout little man with blue cheeks sparkling black eyes and a coloured countenance he wore a short black coat and a large white the black with an immense oval in the centre of it which i mention because i found myself staring mechanically at it during the interview my name is i began with the bearing of a detected can i be of any service to you of a great service he said emphatically you can restore to me the i see had called at last in the shape of a rival i staggered for an instant then i said oh i think you are under a mistake  that dog is not mine i know it he said as been mistake so if dog is not to you you give him back to me i tell you i said that belongs to the gentleman over there and i pointed to the colonel seeing that it was best now to bring him into the affair without delay you are wrong he said is my and i was direct to you  it is your name on and he presented me with that fatal card which i had been foolish enough to give to as a proof of my identity i saw it all now the old villain had betrayed me and to earn a double reward had put the real owner on my track i decided to call the colonel at once and attempt to brazen it out with the help of his sincere belief in the dog the black eh what s that what s it all about said the colonel bustling up followed at intervals by the others the frenchman raised his hat again i do not to make trouble he began but is mistake my word of honour i see my own in your garden ven i appeal to to restore im he me to you you must allow me to know my own dog sir said the colonel why i ve had him from a old boy you know your master don t you but the brute ignored him altogether and began to leap wildly at the hedge in frantic efforts to join the frenchman it needed no solomon to decide i tell you you ave got wrong  it is my own dog my he remember me well you see i lose him it is three four days i see a he is found and ven i go to address tell me oh he is claim he is gone a who has show me i follow ere and ven i arrive i see my in garden before me but look here said the colonel impatiently it s all very well to say that but how can you prove it i give you my word that the dog belongs to me you must prove your claim eh yes said mere assertion is no proof it s oath against oath at present attend an instant  your was he train was he well instruct  a dog tricks eh no he s not said the colonel i don t like the black to see dogs taught to play the fool  there s none of that nonsense about him sir ah remark him well then mon done and on the foreigner s whistling a lively air that infernal rose on his hind legs and danced solemnly about half way round the garden we inside followed his movements with dismay why dash it all cried the disgusted colonel he s dancing along like a d d but it s my for all that you are not convince you	edith-wharton
the light piercing in through the window with fingers by joseph ha watched the first of the morning pointing airy fingers here and there one trembling sun glance falling upon the silver of the red dagger another seeking as it were to find out the hideous face of the dead man but she uttered no word only stood there still and quiet like some strangely statue waiting to be called to life  as she was presently called by an of police and the manager of the hotel after she had given the alarm aroused to action she took upon herself all the of her husband s deed  took it upon herself with the queen like dignity of an angel this man attempted my life and i killed and they knew those common men that when she said her life she meant her honor to her that was her life and they were conscious of her great beauty even as she stood before them pale as a ghost and with hot burning eyes the officer noticed that there was no evidence of a struggle not a curtain was no chair was out of its place the carpet was the room was neat and trim as if nothing unusual had taken place before touching the body he wrote these facts down in his book then laying his hand upon the bundle of clothes he exposed the dead face of the count and requested the hotel manager to admit his two attendant by the fate of one he for a doctor to the other he confided the of lady francis i charge you formally madam with the murder of this man on your own confession which i have written down and i warn you that anything else you may say will be given in evidence against you yes said he attempted my life and i killed him you are my prisoner my lady said the but you may call in any friend you wish to see at the same time i again warn you that anything you may say will be taken down and may be given in evidence against you i will do my duty as as possible but i have a duty to perform and that of course you will understand the first of the newspapers gave conflicting reports of the count s death for a time the public did not understand whether the count had been murdered in his bed by whether he was the victim of vengeance or whether he had committed suicide but on the morning following the tragedy they were with all the strange story and much more besides the confession of lady francis was a text upon which everybody had a sermon to preach but it was speedily a point of comment by joseph ha that the marks upon the throat of the dead man suggested a more powerful grip than that of there was something in the condition of the body which puzzled the this was no ordinary murder everybody agreed nor indeed was it as we know at the the medical testimony showed that death might have been caused either by or by the various that the body it seemed to the that the man had been done to death by some person far more powerful than the prisoner the marks on the throat were almost as strong and the and depression of the as great as would be caused by hanging the man had been by a powerful hand while the had been given with a force that had left the impression of the handle upon the flesh the witnesses were few but they were sufficient to show that a murder had been committed though the jury and the public had evidently grave doubts about the of the prisoner lady francis one of the had asked a pointed question as to the possibility of the deceased having committed suicide this was however only a kindly suggestion in the direction of lady francis s innocence the count had been killed by other hands than his own there was no doubt about that by the fate of what irritated the public in regard to the first day s inquiry was that while there were hints at scandal nothing came out that might be called of course there was the fact that the count was in lady s bedroom at midnight but none of the details that led up to this piece of audacity  if it were audacity  were disclosed the in a mild rebuke administered to the of the jury said the court was assembled to inquire into the death of count de but it was not a court of social investigation it was not an charged with a mission to scandal or to the life and manners of a section of her majesty s subjects while he would take any evidence that bore upon the case however painful that evidence might be to the private feelings or public reputation of even the highest in the land he would not allow that court to be in matters that could only satisfy the and taste of that wretched section of the public which found its chief amusement in french novels and the of vanity fair poor he lived to regret those words even some of the very best newspapers condemned them and the worst called for the s instant dismissal as a to the aristocracy and unfit to over a court of any kind by joseph ha on the first day of the the

of events there lay the end of tliis tangled line i must see that paper said i which this butler of yours thought it his while to consult even at the risk of the loss of his place it is rather an absurd business this of ours he answered but it has at least the saving grace of antiquity to excuse it i have a copy of the questions and answers here if you care to run your eye over them he handed me the very paper which i have here and this is the strange to which each had to submit when he came to man s estate i will read you the questions and answers as they stand  whose was it his who is gone who shall have it he who will come what was the month the sixth from the first where was the sun by the i q over the oak where was the shadow under the elm how was it stepped north by ten and by ten east by five and by five south by two and by two west by one and by one and so under what shall we give for it all that is ours why should we give it for the sake of trust the original has no date but is in the of the middle of the century remarked i am afraid however that it can be of little help to you in this mystery at least said i it gives us another mystery and one which is even more interesting than the first it may be that the solution of the one may prove to be the solution of the other you will excuse me if i say that your butler appears to me to have been a very clever man and to have by of had a clearer insight than ten generations of his masters i hardly follow you said the paper seems to me to be of no practical importance but to me it seems immensely practical and i fancy that took the same view he had probably seen it before that night on which you caught him it is very possible we took no pains to hide it he simply wished i should imagine to refresh his memory upon that last occasion he had as i understand some sort of map or which he was comparing with the manuscript and which he thrust into his pocket when you appeared that is true but what could he have to do with this old family custom of ours and what does this mean  i don t think that we should ha e much difficulty in that said i with your permission we will take the first train down to by the and go a little more deeply into the matter upon the spot the same afternoon saw us both at possibly you have seen pictures and read descriptions of the famous old building so i will confine my account of it to saying that it is built in the shape of an l the long arm being the more modern portion and the shorter the ancient from which the other has developed over the low door in the centre of this old part is the date but are agreed that the beams and are really much older than this the thick walls and tiny windows of this part had in the last century driven the family into building the new wing and the old one was used now as a and a cellar when it was used at all a splendid park with fine old timber surrounded the house and the lake to which my had referred lay close to the avenue about two hundred yards from the building i was already firmly convinced that there were not three separate mysteries here but by of one only and that if i could read the aright i should hold in my hand the due which would lead me to the both the butler and the maid to that then i turned all my energies why should this servant be so anxious to master this old evidently because he saw something in it which had escaped all those generations of country and from which he expected some personal e what was it then and how had it affected his fate it was obvious to me on reading the that the must refer to some spot to which the rest of the document alluded and that if we could find that spot we should be in a fair way towards knowing what the secret was which the old had thought it necessary to in so curious a fashion there were two guides given us to start with an oak and an as to the oak there could be no question at all right in front of the house upon the left hand side of the drive there stood a among oaks one of the most magnificent trees that i have ever seen by the that was there when your was drawn up said i as we drove past it it was there at the conquest in all probability he answered it has a of ft here was one of my fixed points secured have you any old elms i asked there used to be a very old one over yonder but it was struck by lightning ten years ago and we cut down the stump you can sec where it used to be  h yes there are no other elms no old ones but plenty of i should like to see where it grew we had driven up in a dog cart and my led me away at once without our entering the house to the on the lawn where the elm had stood it was nearly between the oak and the house my seemed to be i suppose it is impossible to find out how high the	edith-wharton

slowly but they grind let us be patient with our ancient ally and invite rather than bully her into paths of reform i fear much that the desperate determination of the european nations to secure her

can ask  are being overlooked or ignored into her and the western has fallen for good or evil rudely awakened by the out of her long sleep china half dismayed tinted correspondent concluding remarks and wholly dazed with much loss of face and shaken confidence in the methods of which have served her so well in the past finds herself confronted by an array of powerful grasping ambitious and not always over scrupulous powers bent it may be on over reaching her and each other ringing with hands the of the customs and which are the of for ports and and bewildering her with suggestions and demands of which she sees neither the nor the necessity in this turmoil and with the european nations thundering at her gates it is impossible for china to attempt any which would not from the nature of the case be and superficial the reform of an administration like hers needs the prolonged and careful consideration of the best minds in the empire with such skilled and disinterested foreign advice as was given by sir harry to when she embarked on her new career it must be remembered that the of the system of china is beset with difficulties which have not existed in any other country and which are by the vast population and area of the empire chinese if there be such have to consider what could be carried out with the approval of the masses without bringing about a revolution the very

harness would permit and pitched into the others which sprang to their feet and met the half way all the dogs howled growled and vehemently and in a moment tlie two were rolling upon the ground

neighbors now that she has grown so big i have been told that i care too much for her and perhaps i do my feelings come very near to the against after this confidence i could not help remarking that it would give me great pleasure to see miss for whom i admitted i had conceived a warm admiration did not reply to my suggestion for a moment and i could see his face as he realized that a question of politeness was at issue i did not hesitate he said finally because i have any doubt that i should like to have you come or that would be glad to see you the fact we receive hardly any visitors however an exception shall be made in your case and you may choose as early a date as you desire having said this mr launched into several complimentary expressions which were very agreeable to me coming from a man i esteemed so highly i assured him that i should regard the privilege of entering his home all the more from the fact that it was one so seldom accorded you put the case too strongly he smiled we are very plain people you will see an ordinary the tragedy op my life house with nothing extravagant in the there is but one jewel within its walls that child of mine she must be very dear to you i remarked she is everything to me said he gravely i guard her with the greatest care and yet not in the way that most fathers would think of following while i take pains that her shall be of the best i have not kept her ignorant of the fact that sin forms a part of the arrangements of nature she is hardly thirteen and yet she is as wise indeed in a true sense wiser than many young women of twenty the knowledge that is allowed to come to most girls in a and distorted shape has been imparted to her so gradually that it contains nothing gross when you have seen her i want you to say whether she is not as thoroughly as if she had been lied to and out of information as necessary to her well being as the air she breathes i have been warned that it is a great mistake to be so frank with her but i do not believe it if my experiment were to fail there would be some signs of it before now if there is a danger point she has passed it as i did not pretend to understand the subject and indeed did not thoroughly comprehend at the time what he meant i was silent he repeated that he was at home nearly every evening and should be glad to see me at my earliest convenience there are so few to take a

been strongly attracted toward her my powers of description are wholly inadequate to convey to you the impression she made upon me with the form and stature of a child of thirteen she had a look and manner several years older though her face was not understand this perfectly one of those aged ones that make us wish the vanishing youth would until its proper time for departure it was as fresh and rosy as any infant s before she spoke i noticed her extreme the perfect confidence the absence of timidity and yet nothing like the words that issued from her lips were correct in but neither nor strained her tones were sweet and natural she gave me her hand frankly with a clasp something like that of a boy no doubt to the close companionship she had had with her father rather than with girls of her the of my life age i felt toward her as i had done toward mr when i first knew him i accepted her without reserve there was no attempt at formality in the talk that followed we discussed the affairs of the day exactly as if had been a grown woman she surprised me by proving in the occasional remarks that she that she was a regular reader of the daily newspapers she knew for instance a good deal about a bill that was at that time being discussed in and expressed her opinion as to whether it would pass the house of representatives which was shown by the way in after days to be a

of all if you will listen to the strange story of my married life i will tell it to you so intimate had been the relations of these two men that had reason to believe this matter of the only secret between them as they had been inseparable and husband s in later life harry had gone on his long voyage they had been the most faithful of every item in relation to his business and failures every movement in short that he made had been told by to harry with this exception until the moment just past he had never in the remotest degree alluded to having a wife at all in all his conversations and correspondence with him he knew through other means that his friend was probably married but he was not absolutely sure even of that he had had letters from him in the little town of and had suspected that the mysterious wife was in that place there was no reason for him to attempt to enter upon a domain so guarded and he had never by a word or hint betrayed his suspicions now that had of his own accord offered to open the gates however he was not averse to seeing the interior i will listen to anything you wish to tell me was his quiet reply cleared his throat as if the words he was about to utter required an especially free passage you knew me from childhood to manhood he began can you say up to the time when we parted that you ever saw me show the least interest in any woman mo you were rather noted if anything for a contrary tendency exactly but now i am interested intensely so in two one of them is my wife the mother of my two children the other he hesitated and his eye brows the other have my demands sympathy w nodded his head twas ever thus he mused how much better to do as i have done marry none at ail no responded not for me my nature though it was late in developing demands love feminine love sympathy feminine thy it is necessary to have some one who will share my views my hopes my aspirations and that some one must be of the sex i am as without it as one of the

happened it that you married how he started at the question i will you within a week after you first left me i met the women who aroused in me the only passion of my life she was a year younger than i but with a brain fit for one ten years older i was in love with her from the beginning before i had known her two months all the current of my thoughts had undergone a change she was an i became one she was an i broke every hers that i had ever set up she was a opposed to the rule of any aristocracy either of men or money i followed her into every when we seemed to have grown inseparable when we had become one in soul i found the courage to ask the question that lay nearest my heart and this girl to whom my entire being was attached as by chains of silver expressed the greatest surprise at my declaration and gave me the finish ing blow by announcing that she was soon to bt her husband s friend united to a noted professor of political economy whose adopted daughter she was a man twice her age and without the least physical attractions shook his head slowly and even that did not cure you of your he asked certainly not my views had grown with slow conviction my love was a spontaneous outburst over which i had no control only a man who has never been in love can afford to laugh at its effects when miss told me my hopes were impossible of i could not conceal the terrible pain that it gave me she realized all at once what i was about to suffer she told me that professor had taken her when a child and educated her as if she were his own daughter and when he had asked her to marry him admitting the of the match in many respects she had not known how to refuse him though she had told him frankly that she felt no such love as she had always supposed ought to go with marriage i think it first came into her mind at that moment that she held a dearer place in her heart for me than she had ever realized forgetting the reserve that usage she threw her arms about my neck and sobbed out her sorrow at the she was compelled to inflict upon me she rowed to be to me notwithstanding her marriage a friend for life in every way consistent with duty and honor in the midst of this trying situation the professor opened the door the listener gave a low whistle of astonishment and interest the professor you must understand pursued as no ordinary man he was a os mt h sympathy not only in theory but in practice it probably occurred to him to propose or or even to announce with violent language that the sight he had witnessed would bring his engagement to an end he merely in all

done at first in french or perhaps i should say which was indeed the language of all the better sort and above all of the clergy but in the succeeded in getting permission to have them in english this was celebrated in great pomp at a town which retained the miracle play for several centuries later the several acts of the play which the above event in were by the of the town to wit  the of by the the by the the by the and lot by the the salutation and by the the feeding their flocks by the painters and the three kings by the the of the three kings by the the killing of the by the the by the the temptation by the the last supper by the hie blind men and by the and the by the passion by the and the descent into by the and patriotic the by the the by the anti christ by the the of devil s

at last perhaps in compliment to the monarch edward the third who favoured the english tongue it was he who many years later forbade law causes to be pleaded in french as heretofore a the miracles in bear a and more stamp than the miracles but arose later than the london plays spoken of by and of these i believe them to be from latin into under the impression that their place is between these two i the only known account of them at the period of this account queen elizabeth s reign tradition assigned no date to their commencement they raise an in some open field the country people from all sides many miles off to hear and see it for they have therein and devices to delight as well the eye as the ear the players not their parts without but one called the ordinary at their backs with the in hand and them what to say b the miracles were in a genuine popular national drama so much for nature the author was not paid for these in any part of the world and that england took so marked a lead over every country but spain is good evidence that by nature she is more dramatic than any other nation but spain that same nature crops out in our day from time to time i will give you two specimens that occurred in one month this very year the first is from scotland of i cut it out of a journal on tuesday last the rev mr of read from his own pulpit a poetical tragedy of which he is said to be the author called king it is a five act tragedy the power of madness superstition and a the attempts that were made by the early and the clergy to overcome the saxon tongue were numerous and well planned they would certainly succeeded in most nations but the saxon tongue was defended by the saxon character in other words when the miracle was first established the could not read a line but only the clergy the priest was the author had to be on the stage with his book and played his actors like a i they sounded the eighth jealousy the narrative based on holy writ and containing of character and fine dramatic taste which would not disgrace the pen of the greatest the next is from wales by me from a journal mr w of the british standard that a dramatic performance has taken place in that town presided over by the independent minister i the performance was joseph and his brethren the characters in oriental costume joseph the rest in white the language the engaged from various independent the all expenses went to build a hall it is in our blood it always was ever since the first dim dawn of the on these islands and it will be till the crack of doom money is to the arts what is to soil the moment you open a market you get from nature to another giant culture said the and it is true is ten times truer though let us now leave the spontaneous drama and take a hasty survey of the drama under culture of and   and cap xvii few subjects vary more under separate stages of examination than a comparison of the french and english stages during the th century the works that supply information in the gross such as the the the writers of ana leave a general impression that england had a great drama and france had next to none they scarcely notice a french but who wrote two in the greek form and one comedy robert author of seven pieces between and and hardy author of six hundred pieces whereof scarce sixty survive this fertile author however did not begin to write till about the eighth against this you have in england a of dramatic genius including the names of and green and a dozen lesser stars this is the first stage below those loose authorities to the who in ninety nine cases out of a hundred are more to be trusted and what do they show you that england printed in that whole century about sixty five plays proper exclusive of and mysteries and that france printed nearly double that number these pieces seem to be chiefly and the latter nearly always confined to two personages i give the following as specimens of the century not with any of the list  name of
